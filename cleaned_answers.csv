120,"The Jeff Prosise version from MSDN magazine works pretty well, but it has a few flaws:
AddNode freaks out with links to external sites on your menu (www.google.com, etc.)
Here's my fix in BuildSiteMap():
SiteMapNode node = GetSiteMapNodeFromReader(reader);
string url = node.Url;
if (url.Contains("":""))
{
    string garbage = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();  // SiteMapNode needs unique URLs
    node.Url = ""~/dummy_"" + garbage + "".aspx"";
    AddNode(node, _root);
    node.Url = url;
}
else
{
    AddNode(node, _root);
}

SQLDependency caching is cool, but if you don't want to make a trip to the DB everytime your menu loads (to check to see if the dependency has changed) and your menus don't change very often, then why not use HttpRuntime.Cache instead?
public override SiteMapNode RootNode
{
    get
    {
        SiteMapNode temp = (SiteMapNode)HttpRuntime.Cache[""SomeKeyName""];
        if (temp == null)
        {
            temp = BuildSiteMap();
            HttpRuntime.Cache.Insert(""SomeKeyName"", temp, null, DateTime.Now.AddHours(1), Cache.NoSlidingExpiration);
        }
        return temp;
    }

180,"My first thought on this is ""how generate N vectors in a space that maximize distance from each other."" You can see that the RGB (or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space) are just vectors. Take a look at Random Point Picking. Hope this is a good start for you! Once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part, you can save them in a hash table or something for later, and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other!
Edit: Thinking about this problem more, it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor, possibly (0,0,0) --> (255,255,255) lexicographically, and then distribute them evenly. I really don't know how well this will work, but it should since, lets say:
n = 10
we know we have 16777216 colors (256^3). We can use buckles algorithm 515 to find the lexicographically indexed color.. You'll probably have to edit the algorithm to avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements.

260,"Oleg Shilo's C# Script solution (at The Code Project) really is a great introduction to providing script abilities in your application.
A different approach would be to consider a language that is specifically built for scripting, such as IronRuby, IronPython, or Lua.
IronPython and IronRuby are both available today.
For a guide to embedding IronPython read
How to embed IronPython script support in your existing app in 10 easy steps.
Lua is a scripting language commonly used in games. There is a Lua compiler for .NET, available from CodePlex -- http://www.codeplex.com/Nua
That codebase is a great read if you want to learn about building a compiler in .NET.
A different angle altogether is to try PowerShell. There are numerous examples of embedding PowerShell into an application -- here's a thorough project on the topic:

330,"I would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here.  What if you created an abstract base class for a ""multimedia driver"" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure.
My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem.
I would reference something like a QTextDocument in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation.
"
470,"No, what you're doing is fine. Don't let those people confuse you.
If you've written the web services with .net then the reference proxies generated by .net are going to be quite suitable. The situation you describe (where you are both producer and consumer) is the ideal situation.
If you need to connect to a web services that is unknown at compile time, then you would want a more dynamic approach, where you deduce the 'shape' of the web service. 
But start by using the auto generated proxy class, and don't worry about it until you hit a limitation. And when you do -- come back to stack overflow ;-)"
580,"I've taken to hand-coding all of my DDL (creates/alter/delete) statements, adding them to my .sln as text files, and using normal versioning (using subversion, but any revision control should work). This way, I not only get the benefit of versioning, but updating live from dev/stage is the same process for code and database - tags, branches and so on work all the same.
Otherwise, I agree redgate is expensive if you don't have a company buying it for you. If you can get a company to buy it for you though, it really is worth it!"
650,"With the ""Built in"" stuff, you can't, as using 1.0.* or 1.0.0.* will replace the revision and build numbers with a coded date/timestamp, which is usually also a good way. 
For more info, see the Assembly Linker Documentation in the /v tag.
As for automatically incrementing numbers, use the AssemblyInfo Task:
AssemblyInfo Task
This can be configured to automatically increment the build number.
There are 2 Gotchas:

Each of the 4 numbers in the Version string is limited to 65535. This is a Windows Limitation and unlikely to get fixed.

Why are build numbers limited to 65535?

Using with with Subversion requires a small change:

Using MSBuild to generate assembly version info at build time (including SubVersion fix)


Retrieving the Version number is then quite easy:
Version v = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Version;
string About = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, @""YourApp Version {0}.{1}.{2} (r{3})"", v.Major, v.Minor, v.Build, v.Revision);


And, to clarify: In .net or at least in C#, the build is actually the THIRD number, not the fourth one as some people (for example Delphi Developers who are used to Major.Minor.Release.Build) might expect.
In .net, it's Major.Minor.Build.Revision.

810,"I'm guessing that because you want to set it for all users, that you're on some kind of shared computer, which is probably running under a domain?
HERE BE DRAGONS
Let's say Joe and Jane regularly log onto the computer, then they will each have 'registries'.
You'll then install your app, and the installer will employ giant hacks and disgusting things to set items under HKCU for them.
THEN, bob will come along and log on (he, and 500 other people have accounts in the domain and so can do this). He's never used this computer before, so he has no registry. The first time he logs in, windows creates him one, but he won't have your setting. 
Your app then falls over or behaves incorrectly, and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated.
The correct answer is to just have some default settings in your app, which can write them to the registry if it doesn't find them. It's general good practice that your app should never depend on the registry, and should create things as needed, for any registry entry, not just HKCU, anyway"

1010,"Rex, I suspect a good place to start looking is solutions that compress the ViewState -- they're grabbing ViewState on the server before it's sent down to the client and gzipping it. That's exactly where you want to be.

1040,"Killing other processes is not a healthy thing to do. If your scenario involves something like uninstallation, you could use the MoveFileEx API function to mark the file for deletion upon next reboot.

1070,"The exact definitions of ""vsize,"" ""rss,"" ""rprvt,"" ""rshrd,"" and other obscure-looking abbreviations vary from OS to OS.  The manual pages for the ""top"" and ""ps"" commands will have some sort of description, but all such descriptions are simplified greatly (or are based on long-extinct kernel implementations).  ""Process size"" as a concept is fiendishly difficult to pin down in the general case.  Answers in specific instances depend heavily on the actual memory management implementation in the OS, and are rarely as satisfying as the tidy ""process size"" concept that exists in the minds of most users (and most developers).
For example, none of those numbers (nor, likely, any combination of them) can be used to tell you exactly how many such processes can run at once in a given amount of free memory.  But really, your best bet is to come at it from that end: why do you want this number, and what will you use it for?  Given that information, I think you'll get more useful answers."

1180,"The way we do this is to have a 'catch all' for our domain name registered in DNS so that anything.ourdomain.com will point to our server.
With Apache you can set up a similar catch-all for your vhosts.  The ServerName must be a single static name but the ServerAlias directive can contain a pattern.
Servername www.ourdomain.com
ServerAlias *.ourdomain.com

Now all of the domains will trigger the vhost for our project.  The final part is to decode the domain name actually used so that you can work out the username in your code, something like (PHP):
list( $username ) = explode( ""."", $_SERVER[ ""HTTP_HOST"" ] );

or a RewriteRule as already suggested that silently maps user.ourdomain.com/foo/bar to www.ourdomain.com/foo/bar?user=user or whatever you prefer.

1300,"If you are quite happy with MSBuild, then I would stick with MSBuild.  This may be one of those cases where the tool you learn first is the one you will prefer.  I started with NAnt and can't quite get used to MSBuild.  I'm sure they will both be around for quite some time.
There are some fundamental differences between the two, probably best highlighted by this conversation between some NAnt fans and a Microsoftie.

1600,"It is possible to skip the step of creating the empty database. You can create the new database as part of the restore process.
This is actually the easiest and best way I know of to clone a database. You can eliminate errors by scripting the backup and restore process rather than running it through the SQL Server Management Studio
There are two other options you could explore:

Detach the database, copy the .mdf file and re-attach.
Use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to copy all the objects over

I suggest sticking with backup and restore and automating if necessary."
1610,"You can not do this programatically (in a safe way that is) without creating a new table.

For the conservative types (me), NUnit is still available and still more than capable.
For the Microsoft-types, MSTest is adequate, but slow and clunky compared to Nunit.  It also lacks code coverage without paying the big bucks for the pricey versions of Visual Studio.
There's also MbUnit.  It's like NUnit, but has nifty features like RowTest (run the same test with different parameters) and Rollback (put the database back like you found it after a test) 
And finally, xUnit.net is the trendy option with some attitude.
Oh, and TestDriven.NET will give you IDE integration for both Nunit and MBunit.

I'm sure they're all just fine.  I'd steer away from MSTest though, unless you just enjoy the convenience of having everything in one IDE out of the box.

1970,"I have only really used PL/pgSQL, but that was because I needed a few stored procedures relatively fast and didn't want to add extra modules to the server.
Longer term, I would probably use PL/Perl or PL/Python, as I use perl for quick scripting and have been looking at python for a while now.
One thing I have found is that there is a lack of good documentation for that on the PostgreSQL site. The manuals were thorough as a reference, but did not work well as a tutorial to help show people how it should be done.
That, combined with a very good debugging environment, meant that my first experience of writing procedures involved looking at weird syntax errors for a long time.

2750,"Well, one of the reaons why classes usually contain private members with public getters/setters is exactly because they can verify data.
If you have a Number than can be between 1 and 100, i would definitely put something in the setter that validates that and then maybe throw an exception that is being caught by the code. The reason is simple: If you don't do it in the setter, you have to remember that 1 to 100 limitation every time you set it, which leads to duplicated code or when you forget it, it leads to an invalid state.

If you don't have a background color with an alpha of 255, the algebra gets alot more complicated. I've done it before and it's a fun exercise left to the reader (if you really need to know, ask another question :). 
In other words, what color C blends into some background the same as blending A, then blending B. This is sort of like calculating A+B (which isn't the same as B+A)."

2970,"I know this is a little late in the game, but the URL mentioned for the JavaScript is mentioned in a list of sites known to have been part of the ASPRox bot resurgence that started up in June (at least that's when we were getting flagged with it). Some details about it are mentioned below:
http://www.bloombit.com/Articles/2008/05/ASCII-Encoded-Binary-String-Automated-SQL-Injection.aspx 
The nasty thing about this is that effectively every varchar type field in the database is ""infected"" to spit out a reference to this URL, in which the the browser gets an tiny iframe that turns it into a bot. A basic SQL fix for this can be found here:
http://aspadvice.com/blogs/programming_shorts/archive/2008/06/27/Asprox-Recovery.aspx
The scary thing though is that the virus looks to the system tables for values to infect and a lot of shared hosting plans also share the database space for their clients. So most likely it wasn't even your dad's site that was infected, but somebody else's site within his hosting cluster that wrote some poor code and opened the door to SQL Injection attack.
If he hasn't done so yet, I'd send an URGENT e-mail to their host and give them a link to that SQL code to fix the entire system. You can fix your own affected database tables, but most likely the bots that are doing the infection are going to pass right through that hole again and infect the whole lot.
Hopefully this gives you some more info to work with.
EDIT: One more quick thought, if he's using one of the hosts online design tools for building his website, all of that content is probably sitting in a column and was infected that way."

CPPUnitLite was created by Michael Feathers, who originally ported Java's JUnit to C++ as CPPUnit (CPPUnit tries mimic the development model of JUnit - but C++ lacks Java's features [e.g. reflection] to make it easy to use). 
CPPUnitLite attempts to make a true C++-style testing framework, not a Java one ported to C++. (I'm paraphrasing from Feather's Working Effectively with Legacy Code book). CPPUnitLite2 seems to be another rewrite, with more features and bug fixes.
I also just stumbled across UnitTest++ which includes stuff from CPPUnitLite2 and some other framework.

3180,"I use it, especially since the hosted Version of FugBugz is free for up to 2 people. I found it a lot nicer than paper as I'm working on multiple projects, and my paper tends to get rather messy once you start making annotations or if you want to re-organize and shuffle tasks around, mark them as complete only to see that they are not complete after all...
Plus, the Visual Studio integration is really neat, something paper just cannot compete with. Also, if you lay the project to rest for 6 months and come back, all your tasks and notes are still there, whereas with paper you may need to search all the old documents and notes again, if you did not discard it.
But that is just the point of view from someone who is not really good at staying organized :-) If you are a really tidy and organized person, paper may work better for you than it does for me.
Bonus suggestion: Run Fogbugz on a second PC (or a small Laptop like the eeePC) so that you always have it at your fingertips. The main problem with Task tracking programs - be it FogBugz, Outlook, Excel or just notepad - is that they take up screen space, and my two monitors are usually full with Visual Studio, e-Mail, Web Browsers, some Notepads etc.

3260,"There are lots and lots of classic peak detection methods, any of which might work.  You'll have to see what, in particular, bounds the quality of your data.  Here are basic descriptions:

Between any two points in your data, (x(0),y(0)) and (x(n),y(n)), add up y(i+1)-y(i) for 0 <= i < n and call this T (""travel"") and set R (""rise"") to y(n)- y(0) + k for suitably small k.  T/R > 1 indicates a peak.  This works OK if large travel due to noise is unlikely or if noise distributes symmetrically around a base curve shape.  For your application, accept the earliest peak with a score above a given threshold, or analyze the curve of travel per rise values for more interesting properties.
Use matched filters to score similarity to a standard peak shape (essentially, use a normalized dot-product against some shape to get a cosine-metric of similarity)
Deconvolve against a standard peak shape and check for high values (though I often find 2 to be less sensitive to noise for simple instrumentation output).
Smooth the data and check for triplets of equally spaced points where, if x0 < x1 < x2, y1 > 0.5*(y0+y2), or check Euclidean distances like this:  D((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) + D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) > D((x0,y0),(x2,y2)), which relies on the triangle inequality.  Using simple ratios will again provide you a scoring mechanism.
Fit a very simple 2-gaussian mixture model to your data (for example, Numerical Recipes has a nice ready-made chunk of code).  Take the earlier peak.  This will deal correctly with overlapping peaks.
Find the best match in the data to a simple Gaussian, Cauchy, Poisson, or what-have-you curve.  Evaluate this curve over a broad range and subtract it from a copy of the data after noting it's peak location.  Repeat.  Take the earliest peak whose model parameters (standard deviation probably, but some applications might care about kurtosis or other features) meet some criterion.  Watch out for artifacts left behind when peaks are subtracted from the data.
Best match might be determined by the kind of match scoring suggested in #2 above.

I've done what you're doing before:  finding peaks in DNA sequence data, finding peaks in derivatives estimated from measured curves, and finding peaks in histograms.
I encourage you to attend carefully to proper baselining.  Wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise.
Finally, if your data is typically noisy and you're getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output (or even referenced, just not differential), and if you're averaging lots of observations into each data point, try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains.  There are a host of such outlier elimination tactics that can be really useful.

What do you think the answer to 2 + 3 x 5 is?
Is it (2 + 3) x 5 = 5 x 5 = 25 ?
or 2 + (3 x 5) = 2 + 15 = 17 ?
BODMAS can come to the rescue and give us rules to follow so that we always get the right answer:
(B)rackets (O)rder (D)ivision (M)ultiplication (A)ddition (S)ubtraction
According to BODMAS, multiplication should always be done before addition, therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to BODMAS and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5 .

Why it is useful in programming? No idea, but i assume it's because you can get rid of some brackets? I am a quite defensive programmer, so my lines can look like this:
result = (((i + 4) - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER) - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;

with BODMAS you can make this a bit clearer:
result = (i + 4 - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;

I think i'd still use the first variant - more brackets, but that way i do not have to learn yet another rule and i run into less risk of forgetting it and causing those weird hard to debug errors?
Just guessing at that part though.

4080,"For static analysis tools I often use CPD, PMD, FindBugs, and Checkstyle.
CPD is the PMD ""Copy/Paste Detector"" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the ""Finding Duplicated Code"" link on the PMD web page.
I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their ""out-of-the-box"" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or ""hooks"" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the ""designer"" tool that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the DescendantToken check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.
I integrate these tools with an Ant-based build. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.
In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat ""integrated"" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the ""static-analysis"" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a ""unified"" solution? (I've asked this question separately here)
First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:
/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message
This is often called the ""Emacs format,"" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:
/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.
My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant filterchains.
The second ""integration"" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write ""SuppressWarning?""
For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string ""NOPMD"" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing ""SuppressWarning(PMD."" instead of NOPMD so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:
// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained
Only the ""SuppressWarnings(PMD."" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the @SuppressWarning annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:
@SuppressWarnings(""PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals"") // justification: identity comparision intended
Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings CHECKSTYLE:OFF and CHECKSTYLE:ON, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's ""SuppressionCommentFilter"") to use the strings ""BEGINÂ SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle."" and ""ENDÂ SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle."" makes the controls look more like PMD:

// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: ""Effective Java,"" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2
// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)

With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (HiddenField) is significant because each check has its own ""BEGIN/END"" comment pair.
FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a @SuppressWarnings annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom @SuppressWarnings annotation because the built-in Java @SuppressWarnings annotation has a SOURCE retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation:
@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(""UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR"")
These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string ""SuppressWarnings"" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.

4630,"I'm not sure if this would be handled exactly the same way for webstart, but we ran into this situation in a desktop application when dealing with a set of native libraries (dlls in our case).
Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure 
If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work."

As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html.
As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.
[Edit]
@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:

For example, there is an issue known as a ""hotspot"", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.
Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.
If you even think you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.
Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by this server, but all values generated by all computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created.

Users don't change emails very often

Update
After registration, be sure to ask the user to create some kind of username, don't litter a public site with their email address! Also, another benefit of using an email address as a login: you won't need any other information (like password / password confirm), just send them a temp password through the mail, or forgo passwords altogether and send them a one-use URL to their email address every time they'd like to login (see: mugshot.org)"

6130,"The file in the .svn directory that keeps track of what you have checked out, when, what revision, and from where, has gotten corrupted somehow, for that particular file.
This is no more dangerous or critical than the normal odd file problem, and can be because of various problems, like a subversion program dying mid-change, power-disruption, etc.
Unless it happens more I wouldn't make much out of it.
It can be fixed by doing what you did, make a copy of your work-files, check out a fresh copy, and add the modified files back in.
Note that this might cause problems if you have a busy project where you would normally have to merge in changes.
For instance, you and a collegue both check out a fresh copy, and start working on the same file. At some point, your collegue checks in his modifications. When you attempt to do the same, you get the checksum problem you have. If you now make copies of your changed files, do a fresh checkout, then subversion will lose track of how your changes should be merged back in.
If you didn't get the problem in this case, when you got around to checkin in your modifications, you would need to update your working copy first, and possibly handle a conflict with your file.
However, if you do a fresh checkout, complete with your collegues changes, it now looks like you removed his changes and substituted with your own. No conflicts, and no indications from subversion that something is amiss."

6890,"How much order do you need to impose on the threads? If you just need all of the work started in the loop to finish before the code continues, but you don't care about the order the work within the loop finishes, then calling Join is the answer. To add more detail to Kevin Kenny's answer, you should call Join outside the loop. This means you will need a collection to hold references to the threads you started:
// Start all of the threads.
List<Thread> startedThreads = new List<Thread>();
foreach (...) {
  Thread thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(MyMethod));
  thread.Start();
  startedThreads.Add(thread);
}

// Wait for all of the threads to finish.
foreach (Thread thread in startedThreads) {
  thread.Join();
}

In contrast, if you called Join inside the loop, the result would basically be the same as not using threads at all. Each iteration of the loop body would create and start a thread but then immediately Join it and wait for it to finish.
If the individual threads produce some result (write a message in a log, for example) then the messages may still appear out of order because there's no coordination between the threads. It is possible to get the threads to output their results in order by coordinating them with a Monitor.

Then, connect to the remote machine you want to login to, to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys add the contents of your that id_rsa.pub file.
Oh, and chmod 600 all the id_rsa* files (both locally and remote), so no other users can read them:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa*

Similarly, ensure the remote ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file is chmod 600 also:

7440,"I'm a huge fan of Selenium. Saying 'unit-testing your web ui' isn't exactly accurate as some of the comments have mentioned. However, I do find Selenium to be incredibly useful for performing those sort of acceptance and sanity tests on the UI.
A good way to get started is using Selenium IDE as part of your development. Ie, just have the IDE open as you're developing and write your test as you go to cut down on your dev time. (Instead of having to manually go through the UI to get to the point where you can test whatever you're working on, just hit a button and Selenium IDE will take care of that for you. It's a terrific time-saver!)
Most of my major use case scenarios have Selenium RC tests to back them up. You can't really think of them as unit-tests along the lines of an xUnit framework, but they are tests targetted to very specific functionality. They're quick to write (especially if you implement common methods for things like logging in or setting up your test cases), quick to run, and provide a very tight feedback loop. In those senses Selenium RC tests are very similar to unit-tests.
I think, like anything else, if you put the effort into properly learning a test tool (eg, Selenium), your effort will pay off in spades. You mention that your company already uses Selenium to do UI testing. This is great. Work with it. If you find Selenium hard to use, or confusing, stick with it. The learning curve really isn't all that steep once you learn the API a little bit.
If I'm working on a web app, its rare for me to write a significant amount of code without Selenium RC tests to back it up. That's how effective I find Selenium. :) (Hopefully that'll answer your question..)

7540,"It's probably the awesome firefox3 fsync ""bug"", which is a giant pile of fail.
In summary

Firefox3 saves its bookmarks and history in an SQLite database
Every time you load a page it writes to this database several times
SQLite cares deeply that you don't lose your bookmarks, so each time it writes, instructs the kernel to flush it's database file to disk and ensure that it's fully written
Many variants of linux, when told to flush like that, flush EVERY FILE. This may take up to a minute or more if you have background tasks doing any kind of disk intensive stuff.
The kernel makes firefox wait while this flush happens, which locks up the UI.

7720,"To follow up on pauxu's answer, I'm using launch4j and NSIS on a project of mine and thought it would be helpful to show just how I'm using them.  Here's what I'm doing for Windows.  BTW, I'm creating .app and .dmg for Mac, but haven't figured out what to do for Linux yet.
Project Copies of launch4j and NSIS
In my project I have a ""vendor"" directory and underneath it I have a directory for ""launch4j"" and ""nsis"".  Within each is a copy of the install for each application.  I find it easier to have a copy local to the project rather than forcing others to install both products and set up some kind of environment variable to point to each.
Script Files
I also have a ""scripts"" directory in my project that holds various configuration/script files for my project.  First there is the launch4j.xml file:
<launch4jConfig>
  <dontWrapJar>true</dontWrapJar>
  <headerType>gui</headerType>
  <jar>rpgam.jar</jar>
  <outfile>rpgam.exe</outfile>
  <errTitle></errTitle>
  <cmdLine></cmdLine>
  <chdir>.</chdir>

Ant Integration
I have some targets in my Ant buildfile (build.xml) to handle the above.  First I tel Ant to import launch4j's Ant tasks:
<property name=""launch4j.dir"" location=""vendor/launch4j"" />
<taskdef name=""launch4j"" 
    classname=""net.sf.launch4j.ant.Launch4jTask""
    classpath=""${launch4j.dir}/launch4j.jar:${launch4j.dir}/lib/xstream.jar"" />

I then have a simple target for creating the wrapper executable:
<target name=""executable-windows"" depends=""jar"" description=""Create Windows executable (EXE)"">
    <launch4j configFile=""scripts/launch4j.xml"" outfile=""${exeFile}"" />
</target>

And another target for making the installer:
<target name=""installer-windows"" depends=""executable-windows"" description=""Create the installer for Windows (EXE)"">
    <!-- Lay out files needed for building the installer -->
    <mkdir dir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" />
    <copy file=""${jarFile}"" todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" />
    <copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}/lib"">
        <fileset dir=""${libraryDirectory}"" />
        <fileset dir=""${windowsLibraryDirectory}"" />
    </copy>
    <copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}/icons"">
         <fileset dir=""${iconsDirectory}"" />
    </copy>
    <copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" file=""${exeFile}"" />

    <mkdir dir=""${windowsInstallerDirectory}"" />

    <!-- Build the installer using NSIS -->
    <exec executable=""vendor/nsis/makensis.exe"">
        <arg value=""/DVERSION=${version}"" />
        <arg value=""scripts/rpgam-setup.nsi"" />
    </exec>
</target>

The top portion of that just copies the necessary files for the installer to a temporary location and the second half executes the script that uses all of it to make the installer.

"
9240,"If I understand the question correctly, you've created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.
Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.
The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.
E.g
public class User
{
	private string name;
	private AccountStatus status;

	private User()
	{
	}

	public string Name
	{
		get { return name; }
		set { name = value; }
	}

	public AccountStatus Status
	{
		get { return status; }
	}

	public void Activate()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Active;
	}

	public void Suspend()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Suspended;
	}

	public static User GetById(int id)
	{
		User fetchedUser = new User();

		// Lots of database and error-checking code
		// omitted for clarity
		// ...

		fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[""Name""];
		fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[""statusCode""] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;

		return fetchedUser;
	}

	public static void Save(User user)
	{
		// Code to save User's internal structure to database
		// ...
	}
}

In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.
The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:
  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)
  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally
  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++
For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'
However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.
"
9410,"Declaration
A prototype for a function which takes a function parameter looks like the following:
void func ( void (*f)(int) );

This states that the parameter f will be a pointer to a function which has a void return type and which takes a single int parameter. The following function (print) is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type:
void print ( int x ) {
  printf(""%d\n"", x);
}

Function Call
When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parentheses) for this:
func(print);

would call func, passing the print function to it.
Function Body
As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly:
for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) {
  print(ctr);
}

Since func's parameter declaration says that f is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if f is a pointer then *f is the thing that f points to (i.e. the function print in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with *f:
void func ( void (*f)(int) ) {
  for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) {
    (*f)(ctr);
  }
}

10300,"Here's an overview of the flow in MVC:

/new - render your ""New"" view containing a form for the user to fill out
User fills out form and it is posted to /create
The post is routed to the Create action on your controller
In your action method, update the model with the data that was posted.
Your Model should validate itself.
Your Controller should read if the model is valid.
If the Model is valid, save it to your db.  Redirect to /show to render the show View for your object.
If the Model is invalid, save the form values and error messages in the TempData, and redirect to the New action again.  Fill your form fields with the data from TempData and show the error message(s).

The validation frameworks will help you along in this process.  Also, I think the ASP.NET MVC team is planning a validation framework for the next preview.

Not only will this scenario be very quick indeed but it will open up the options to utilise the various snapshot techniques that these boxes have to offer.

Antonio is right; if you need to pass extra parameters, you'll need to redefine your function pointer to accept the additional arguments. If you don't know exactly what parameters you'll need, then you have at least three choices:

Have the last argument in your prototype be a void*. This gives you flexibility of passing in anything else that you need, but it definitely isn't type-safe.
Use variadic parameters (...). Given my lack of experience with variadic parameters in C, I'm not sure if you can use this with a function pointer, but this gives even more flexibility than the first solution, albeit still with the lack of type safety.

netstat -rn

Your gateway's IP address will appear in the second field of the line that starts either default or 0.0.0.0.
This gets around a number of problems with trying to use traceroute:

on Windows traceroute is actually tracert.exe, so there's no need for O/S dependencies in the code
it's a quick command to run - it gets information from the O/S, not from the network
traceroute is sometimes blocked by the network

The only downside is that it will be necessary to keep reading lines from the netstat output until the right line is found, since there'll be more than one line of output.

12890,"I know more about mssql that mysql, but I don't think the number of joins or number of rows you are talking about should cause you too many problems with the correct indexes in place.  Have you analyzed the query plan to see if you are missing any?
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html
That being said, once you are satisifed with your indexes and have exhausted all other avenues, de-normalization might be the right answer.  If you just have one or two queries that are problems, a manual approach is probably appropriate, whereas some sort of data warehousing tool might be better for creating a platform to develop data cubes.
Here's a site I found that touches on the subject:
http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D
Here's a simple technique that you can use to keep denormalizing queries simple, if you're just doing a few at a time (and I'm not replacing your OLTP tables, just creating a new one for reporting purposes).  Let's say you have this query in your application:
select a.name, b.address from tbla a 
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id where a.id=1

You could create a denormalized table and populate with almost the same query:
create table tbl_ab (a_id, a_name, b_address); 
-- (types elided)

Notice the underscores match the table aliases you use
insert tbl_ab select a.id, a.name, b.address from tbla a
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id 
-- no where clause because you want everything

Then to fix your app to use the new denormalized table, switch the dots for underscores.  
select a_name as name, b_address as address 
from tbl_ab where a_id = 1;

For huge queries this can save a lot of time and makes it clear where the data came from, and you can re-use the queries you already have.
Remember, I'm only advocating this as the last resort.  I bet there's a few indexes that would help you.  And when you de-normalize, don't forget to account for the extra space on your disks, and figure out when you will run the query to populate the new tables.  This should probably be at night, or whenever activity is low.  And the data in that table, of course, will never exactly be up to date.
[Yet another edit]  Don't forget that the new tables you create need to be indexed too!  The good part is that you can index to your heart's content and not worry about update lock contention, since aside from your bulk insert the table will only see selects.

13000,"Most PHP sites should have a file (I call it a header) that you include on every single page of the site. If you put that first line of code in the header file, then include it like this on every page:
 include 'header.php';

you won't have to use the global keyword or anything, the second line of code you wrote should work.
Edit: Oh sorry, that won't work inside functions... now I see your problem.
Edit #2: Ok, take my original advice with the header, but use a define() rather than a variable. Those work inside functions after being included.
"
13060,"By default (in C#), passing an object to a function actually passes a copy of the reference to that object. Changing the parameter itself only changes the value in the parameter, and not the variable that was specified.
void Test1(string param)
{
    param = ""new value"";
}

string s1 = ""initial value"";
Test1(s1);
// s1 == ""initial value""

Using out or ref passes a reference to the variable specified in the call to the function. Any changes to the value of an out or ref parameter will be passed back to the caller.
Both out and ref behave identically except for one slight difference: ref parameters are required to be initialised before calling, while out parameters can be uninitialised. By extension, ref parameters are guaranteed to be initialised at the start of the method, while out parameters are treated as uninitialised.
void Test2(ref string param)
{
    param = ""new value"";
}

void Test3(out string param)
{
    // Use of param here will not compile
    param = ""another value"";
}

string s2 = ""initial value"";
string s3;
Test2(ref s2);
// s2 == ""new value""
// Test2(ref s3); // Passing ref s3 will not compile
Test3(out s2);
// s2 == ""another value""
Test3(out s3);
// s3 == ""another value""

Edit: As dp points out, the difference between out and ref is only enforced by the C# compiler, not by the CLR. As far as I know, VB has no equivalent for out and implements ref (as ByRef) only, matching the support of the CLR.

13160,"It depends on how often you are going to be calling the web service.  If you're going to be calling it almost constantly, it would probably be better to use method #2.

13170,"It's possible for a thread to be in more than one state at once therefore the ThreadState property is actually a bitmap of possible states. So testing for equality with just one state will not give you the right result. You would need to do something like:
if((mThread.ThreadState & ThreadState.Running) != 0)

However, checking thread state is the wrong to do anything. I'm not entirely clear what you're trying to achieve but I will guess that you're waiting for a thread to terminate before restarting it. In that case you should do:
mThread.Join();
mThread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(Monitor));
if(check)
    mThread.Start(60000);
else
    mThread.Start(0);

Although if you describe the problem you're trying to solve in more detail I'm almost certain there will be a better solution. Waiting around for a thread to end just to restart it again doesn't seem that efficient to me. Perhaps you just need some kind of inter-thread communication?

13200,"At my company we've recently adopted the (commercial) Atlassian stack - including JIRA for issue tracking and Bamboo for builds. Much like the Microsoft world (I'm guessing - we're a Java shop), if you get all your products from a single vendor you get the bonus of tight integration.
For an example of how they've done interoperability, view their interoperability page.
Enough shilling. Generally speaking, I can summarize their general approach as:

Create issues in your bug tracker (ex: issue key of PROJ-123).
When you commit code, add ""PROJ-123"" to your commit comment to indicate what bug this code change fixes.
When your CI server checks out the code, scan the commit comments of the diffs. Record any strings matching the regex of your issue keys.
When the build completes, generate a report of what issue keys were found.

Specifically to your second problem:
Your CI doesn't doesn't have to put anything into your bug tracker. Bamboo doesn't put anything into JIRA. Instead, the Atlassian folks have provided a plugin to JIRA that will make a remote api call into Bamboo, asking the question ""Bamboo, to what builds am I (a JIRA issue) related?"". This is probably best explained with a screenshot.

13460,"Think of source control as a giant ""Undo"" button for your source code. Every time you check in, you're adding a point to which you can roll back. Even if you don't use branching/merging, this feature alone can be very valuable.
Additionally, by having one 'authoritative' version of the source control, it becomes much easier to back up.
Centralized vs. distributed... the difference is really that in distributed, there isn't necessarily one 'authoritative' version of the source control, although in practice people usually still do have the master tree.
The big advantage to distributed source control is two-fold:

When you use distributed source control, you have the whole source tree on your local machine. You can commit, create branches, and work pretty much as though you were all alone, and then when you're ready to push up your changes, you can promote them from your machine to the master copy. If you're working ""offline"" a lot, this can be a huge benefit.
You don't have to ask anybody's permission to become a distributor of the source control. If person A is running the project, but person B and C want to make changes, and share those changes with each other, it becomes much easier with distributed source control.

13540,"Your assumption is right, this is the optimal way to do it and it's called upsert/merge.
Importance of UPSERT - from sqlservercentral.com: 

For every update in the case mentioned above we are removing one
  additional read from the table if we
  use the UPSERT instead of EXISTS.
  Unfortunately for an Insert, both the
  UPSERT and IF EXISTS methods use the
  same number of reads on the table.
  Therefore the check for existence
  should only be done when there is a
  very valid reason to justify the
  additional I/O. The optimized way to
  do things is to make sure that you
  have little reads as possible on the
  DB.
The best strategy is to attempt the
  update. If no rows are affected by the
  update then insert. In most
  circumstances, the row will already
  exist and only one I/O will be
  required.

14040,"It's the difference between ""black box"" testing (where you know what the code is supposed to do, but not how it works), and ""white box"" testing (where knowing how it works drives how you test it). ""Black box"" testing is what most people think of when you mention Quality Assurance.
I work for a company where the QA team are also software developers.  (That narrows the field a lot if you care to guess the company.)  I know Joel's opinion, and my experience leads me to partially disagree: for the same reason that a ""white hat"" hacker is more effective finding security holes, certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code (and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example, resource management issues like memory leaks).  
Also, since QA-oriented developers are part of the process from the initial design phase, they can theoretically help to drive higher-quality code throughout the process.  Ideally, for each developer working on the project with a mental focus on functionality, you have an opposing developer with a mental focus on breaking the code (and thus making it better).  
Seen in that light, it's less a matter of using developers for testers than it is kind of disconnected pair-programming where one developer has an emphasis on controlling quality.  
On the other hand, a lot of testing (such as basic UI functionality) frankly doesn't need that kind of skill.  That's where Joel has a point. 
For many businesses, I could see a system where programming teams trade off code review and testing duties for each others' code.  Members of the Business Logic team, for example, could spend an occasional tour testing and reviewing code for the UI team, and vice-versa.  That way you're not ""wasting"" developer talent on full-time testing, but you are gaining the advantages of exposing the code to (hopefully) expert scrutiny and punishment.  Then, a more traditional QA team can take up the ""black box"" testing.

14530,"Some advantages of LINQ over sprocs:

Type safety: I think we all understand this.
Abstraction: This is especially true with LINQ-to-Entities.  This abstraction also allows the framework to add additional improvements that you can easily take advantage of.  PLINQ is an example of adding multi-threading support to LINQ.  Code changes are minimal to add this support.  It would be MUCH harder to do this data access code that simply calls sprocs.
Debugging support: I can use any .NET debugger to debug the queries.  With sprocs, you cannot easily debug the SQL and that experience is largely tied to your database vendor (MS SQL Server provides a query analyzer, but often that isn't enough).
Vendor agnostic: LINQ works with lots of databases and the number of supported databases will only increase.  Sprocs are not always portable between databases, either because of varying syntax or feature support (if the database supports sprocs at all).
Deployment: Others have mentioned this already, but it's easier to deploy a single assembly than to deploy a set of sprocs.  This also ties in with #4.
Easier: You don't have to learn T-SQL to do data access, nor do you have to learn the data access API (e.g. ADO.NET) necessary for calling the sprocs.  This is related to #3 and #4.

Some disadvantages of LINQ vs sprocs:

Network traffic: sprocs need only serialize sproc-name and argument data over the wire while LINQ sends the entire query.  This can get really bad if the queries are very complex.  However, LINQ's abstraction allows Microsoft to improve this over time.
Less flexible: Sprocs can take full advantage of a database's featureset.  LINQ tends to be more generic in it's support.  This is common in any kind of language abstraction (e.g. C# vs assembler).
Recompiling: If you need to make changes to the way you do data access, you need to recompile, version, and redeploy your assembly.  Sprocs can sometimes allow a DBA to tune the data access routine without a need to redeploy anything.

Security and manageability are something that people argue about too.

Security: For example, you can protect your sensitive data by restricting access to the tables directly, and put ACLs on the sprocs.  With LINQ, however, you can still restrict direct access  to tables and instead put ACLs on updatable table views to achieve a similar end (assuming your database supports updatable views).  
Manageability: Using views also gives you the advantage of shielding your application non-breaking from schema changes (like table normalization).  You can update the view without requiring your data access code to change.

I used to be a big sproc guy, but I'm starting to lean towards LINQ as a better alternative in general.  If there are some areas where sprocs are clearly better, then I'll probably still write a sproc but access it using LINQ. :)
"
14570,"
Should I just do it when I'm going to use it?

I would recommend that you only retrieve the data when you are going to use it. If you are not going to need it, there is no reason to waste resources by retrieving it in Page_Load. If you are going to need it multiple times throughout the page load, consider saving the query results to a private variable or collection so that the same data can be reused multiple times throughout the page load.

Am I opening a new connection when I create a new instance?

Asp.net handles connection pooling, and opens and closes connections in an efficient way. You shouldn't have to worry about this.
One other thing to consider from a performance perspective is to avoid using Datasets and TableAdapters. In many cases, they add extra overhead into data retrieval that does not exist when using Linq to Sql, Stored Procedures or DataReaders.

14770,"In solutions with multiple projects, one thing I've found very helpful is to have all the AssemblyInfo files point to a single project that governs the versioning. So my AssemblyInfos have a line:

namespace Foo
{
    public static class StaticVersion

         public const string Bar= ""3.0.216.0""; // 08/01/2008 17:28:35

Does anyone know of anyway to
  reduce/optimize the PDF export phase
  and or the size of the PDF without
  lowering the total page count?


I have a few ideas and questions:
1. Is this a graphics-heavy report?  If not, do you have tables that start out as text but are converted into a graphic by the SSRS PDF renderer (check if you can select the text in the PDF)?  41K per page might be more than it should be, or it might not, depending on how information-dense your report is.  But we've had cases where we had minor issues with a report's layout, like having a table bleed into the page's margins, that resulted in the SSRS PDF renderer ""throwing up its hands"" and rendering the table as an image instead of as text.  Obviously, the fewer graphics in your report, the smaller your file size will be.
2. Is there a way that you could easily break the report into pieces?  E.g., if it's a 10-location report, where Location 1 is followed by Location 2, etc., on your final report, could you run the Location 1 portion independent of the Location 2 portion, etc.?  If so, you could join the 10 sub-reports into one final PDF using PDFSharp after you've received them all.  This leads to some difficulties with page numbering, but nothing insurmountable.

3. Does anyone else have any other
  theories as to why this runs on the
  server but not through the API?

My guess would be the sheer size of the report.  I don't remember everything about what's an IIS setting and what's SSRS-specific, but there might be some overall IIS settings (maybe in Metabase.xml) that you would have to be updated to even allow that much data to pass through. 
You could isolate the question of whether the time is the problem by taking one of your working reports and building in a long wait time in your stored procedures with WAITFOR (assuming SQL Server for your DBMS).
Not solutions, per se, but ideas.  Hope it helps.

15390,"The approach that I've found works for me is having seperate JS files for each class (just as you would in Java, C# and others). Alternatively you can group your JS into application functional areas if that's easier for you to navigate.
If you put all your JS files into one directory, you can have your server-side environment (PHP for instance) loop through each file in that directory and output a <script src='/path/to/js/$file.js' type='text/javascript'> in some header file that is included by all your UI pages. You'll find this auto-loading especially handy if you're regularly creating and removing JS files.
When deploying to production, you should have a script that combines them all into one JS file and ""minifies"" it to keep the size down.

16100,"It's rather ugly:
StatusEnum MyStatus = (StatusEnum) Enum.Parse(typeof(StatusEnum), ""Active"", true);

I tend to simplify this with:
public static T ParseEnum<T>(string value)
{
    return (T) Enum.Parse(typeof(T), value, true);
}

Then I can do:
StatusEnum MyStatus = EnumUtil.ParseEnum<StatusEnum>(""Active"");

One option suggested in the comments is to add an extension, which is simple enough:
public static T ToEnum<T>(this string value)
{
    return (T) Enum.Parse(typeof(T), value, true);
}

StatusEnum MyStatus = ""Active"".ToEnum<StatusEnum>();

Finally, you may want to have a default enum to use if the string cannot be parsed:
public static T ToEnum<T>(this string value, T defaultValue) 
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value))
    {
        return defaultValue;
    }

    T result;
    return Enum.TryParse<T>(value, true, out result) ? result : defaultValue;
}

Which makes this the call:
StatusEnum MyStatus = ""Active"".ToEnum(StatusEnum.None);

However, I would be careful adding an extension method like this to string as (without namespace control) it will appear on all instances of string whether they hold an enum or not (so 1234.ToString().ToEnum(StatusEnum.None) would be valid but nonsensical) . It's often be best to avoid cluttering Microsoft's core classes with extra methods that only apply in very specific contexts unless your entire development team has a very good understanding of what those extensions do.

16140,"Well, since you can not have one part OSGi and one part non-OSGi you'll need to make your entire app OSGi. In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).
To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.
Some help can come from tools like JDepend which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like Structure 101.
Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from ""normal"" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.
OSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:

OSGi R4 Specification: Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable. Have a shortcut to them handy at all times, you will consult them.
Read up on OSGi best practices, there is a large set of things you can do but a somewhat smaller set of things you should do and there are some things you should never do (DynamicImport: * for example).

16320,"I like a single object to be correlated to a single record in the database, i.e. an object must be instantiated.  This is your basic ActiveRecord pattern.  In my experience, the one-object-to-one-row approach creates a much more fluid and literate presentation in code.  Also, I like to treat objects as records and the class as the table. For example to change the name of a record I do:
objPerson = new Person(id)

objPerson.name = ""George""

objPerson.save()

while to get all people who live in Louisiana I might do
aryPeople = Person::getPeopleFromState(""LA"")

There are plenty of criticisms of Active Record.  You can especially run into problems where you are querying the database for each record or your classes are tightly coupled to your database, creating inflexibility in both.  In that case you can move up a level and go with something like DataMapper. 
Many of the modern frameworks and ORM's are aware of some of these drawbacks and provide solutions for them.  Do a little research and you will start to see that this is a problem that has a number of solutions and it all depend on your needs.

The checking rule is:

Are the hash codes not equal? Then the two items are definitely not equal.

All you want is a GetHashCode algorithm that splits up your collection into roughly even groups - it shouldn't form the key as the HashTable or Dictionary<> will need to use the hash to optimise retrieval.
How long do you expect the data to be? How random? If lengths vary greatly (say for files) then just return the length.  If lengths are likely to be similar look at a subset of the bytes that varies.
GetHashCode should be a lot quicker than Equals, but doesn't need to be unique.
Two identical things must never have different hash codes. Two different objects should not have the same hash code, but some collisions are to be expected (after all, there are more permutations than possible 32 bit integers).

16610,"I posted an answer on another question on another topic that might have some use here.  That answer involved SMB connections, not SQL.  However it was identical in that it involved a low-level transport error.
What we found was that in a heavy load situation, it was fairly easy for the remote server to time out connections at the TCP layer simply because the server was busy.  Part of the reason was the defaults for how many times TCP will retransmit data on Windows weren't appropriate for our situation.
Take a look at the registry settings for tuning TCP/IP on Windows.  In particular you want to look at TcpMaxDataRetransmissions and maybe TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions.  These default to 5 and 2 respectively, try upping them a little bit on the client system and duplicate the load situation.
Don't go crazy!  TCP doubles the timeout with each successive retransmission, so the timeout behavior for bad connections can go exponential on you if you increase these too much.  As I recall upping TcpMaxDataRetransmissions to 6 or 7 solved our problem in the vast majority of cases.

16770,"Haskell's algebraic data types are named such since they correspond to an initial algebra in category theory, giving us some laws, some operations and some symbols to manipulate. We may even use algebraic notation for describing regular data structures, where:

+ represents sum types (disjoint unions, e.g. Either).
Ã¢ÂÂ¢ represents product types (e.g. structs or tuples)
X for the singleton type (e.g. data X a = X a)
1 for the unit type ()
and ÃÂ¼ for the least fixed point (e.g. recursive types), usually implicit.

with some additional notation:

XÃÂ² for XÃ¢ÂÂ¢X

In fact, you might say (following Brent Yorgey) that a Haskell data type is regular if it can be expressed in terms of 1, X, +, Ã¢ÂÂ¢, and a least Ã¯Â¬Âxed point.
With this notation, we can concisely describe many regular data structures:

Units: data () = ()
1
Options: data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
1 + X
Lists: data [a] = [] | a : [a]
L = 1+XÃ¢ÂÂ¢L
Binary trees: data BTree a = Empty | Node a (BTree a) (BTree a)
B = 1 + XÃ¢ÂÂ¢BÃÂ²

Other operations hold (taken from Brent Yorgey's paper, listed in the references):

Expansion: unfolding the fix point can be helpful for thinking about lists. L = 1 + X + XÃÂ² + XÃÂ³ + ... (that is, lists are either empty, or they have one element, or two elements, or three, or ...)
Composition, Ã¢ÂÂ¦, given types F and G, the composition F Ã¢ÂÂ¦ G is a type which builds Ã¢ÂÂF-structures made out of G-structuresÃ¢ÂÂ (e.g. R = X Ã¢ÂÂ¢ (L Ã¢ÂÂ¦ R) ,where L is lists, is a rose tree.
Differentiation, the derivative of a data type D (given as D') is the type of D-structures with a single Ã¢ÂÂholeÃ¢ÂÂ, that is, a distinguished location not containing any data. That amazingly satisfy the same rules as for differentiation in calculus:
1Ã¢ÂÂ² = 0
XÃ¢ÂÂ² = 1
(F + G)Ã¢ÂÂ² = F' + GÃ¢ÂÂ²
(F Ã¢ÂÂ¢ G)Ã¢ÂÂ² = F Ã¢ÂÂ¢ GÃ¢ÂÂ² + FÃ¢ÂÂ² Ã¢ÂÂ¢ G
(F Ã¢ÂÂ¦ G)Ã¢ÂÂ² = (FÃ¢ÂÂ² Ã¢ÂÂ¦ G) Ã¢ÂÂ¢ GÃ¢ÂÂ²

So when writing a function or method that takes a collection, write it not to take a List, but an IList<T>, an ICollection<T>, or IEnumerable<T>.  The generic interfaces will still work even for heterogenous lists because System.Object can be a T too.  Doing this will save you headache if you decide to use a Stack or some other data structure further down the road.  If all you need to do in the function is foreach through it, IEnumerable<T> is really all you should be asking for.
On the other hand, when returning an object out of a function, you want to give the user the richest possible set of operations without them having to cast around.  So in that case, if it's a List<T> internally, return a copy as a List<T>.

17370,"Yes, the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a painless way to use OpenGL extensions on Windows. Here's how to get started on it:
Identify the OpenGL extension and the extension APIs you wish to use. OpenGL extensions are listed in the OpenGL Extension Registry.
Check if your graphic card supports the extensions you wish to use. Download and install the latest drivers and SDKs for your graphics card.
Recent versions of NVIDIA OpenGL SDK ship with GLEW. If you're using this, then you don't need to do some of the following steps.
Download GLEW and unzip it.
Add the GLEW bin path to your Windows PATH environment variable. Alternatively, you can also place the glew32.dll in a directory where Windows picks up its DLLs.
Add the GLEW include path to your compiler's include directory list.
Add the GLEW lib path to your compiler's library directory list.
Instruct your compiler to use glew32.lib during linking. If you're using Visual C++ compilers then one way to do this is by adding the following line to your code:
#pragma comment(lib, ""glew32.lib"")

Add a #include <GL/glew.h> line to your code. Ensure that this is placed above the includes of other GL header files. (You may actually not need the GL header files includes if you include glew.h.)
Initialize GLEW using glewInit() after you've initialized GLUT or GL. If it fails, then something is wrong with your setup.
if (GLEW_OK != glewInit())
{
    // GLEW failed!
    exit(1);
}

Check if the extension(s) you wish to use are now available through GLEW. You do this by checking a boolean variable named GLEW_your_extension_name which is exposed by GLEW.

Example:

if (!GLEW_EXT_framebuffer_object)
{
    exit(1);
}

That's it! You can now use the OpenGL extension calls in your code just as if they existed naturally for Windows.

18010,"Older AnkhSVN (pre 2.0) was very crappy and I was only using it for shiny icons in the solution explorer. I relied on Tortoise for everything except reverts.
The newer Ankh is a complete rewrite (it is now using the Source Control API of the IDE) and looks & works much better. Still, I haven't forced it to any heavy lifting. Icons is enough for me.
The only gripe I have with 2.0 is the fact that it slaps its footprint to .sln files. I always revert them lest they cause problems for co-workers who do not have Ankh installed. Dunno if my fears are groundless or not.

18450,"There are a couple of scenarios to consider: (a) if you are porting an existing application and wondering if Mono is good enough for this task;   (b) you are starting to write some new code, and you want to know if Mono is mature enough.
For the first case, you can use the Mono Migration Analyzer tool (Moma) to evaluate how far your application is from running on Mono.  If the evaluation comes back with flying colors, you should start on your testing and QA and get ready to ship.
If your evaluation comes back with a report highlighting features that are missing or differ significantly in their semantics in Mono you will have to evaluate whether the code can be adapted, rewritten or in the worst case whether your application can work with reduced functionality.      
According to our Moma statistics based on user submissions (this is from memory) about 50% of the applications work out of the box, about 25% require about a week worth of work (refactoring, adapting) another 15% require a serious commitment to redo chunks of your code, and the rest is just not worth bothering porting since they are so incredibly tied to Win32.   At that point, either you start from zero, or a business decision will drive the effort to make your code portable, but we are talking months worth of work (at least from the reports we have).
If you are starting from scratch, the situation is a lot simpler, because you will only be using the APIs that are present in Mono.   As long as you stay with the supported stack (which is pretty much .NET 2.0, plus all the core upgrades in 3.5 including LINQ and System.Core, plus any of the Mono cross-platform APIs) you will be fine.  
Every once in a while you might run into bugs in Mono or limitations, and you might have to work around them, but that is not different than any other system.
As for portability: ASP.NET applications are the easier ones to port, as those have little to no dependencies on Win32 and you can even use SQL server or other popular databases (there are plenty of bundled database providers with Mono).   
Windows.Forms porting is sometimes trickier because developers like to escape the .NET sandbox and P/Invoke their brains out to configure things as useful as the changing the cursor blinking rate expressed as two bezier points encoded in BCD form in a wParam.   Or some junk like that.

I want to add a rule that checks for
  the presence of a folder.jpg file in
  each directory, but to add this would
  make the code substantially more messy
  in it's current state..

This doesn't look bad.  In fact your current code does it very nicely, and Sven mentioned a good way to do it as well:

Get a list of all the files
Check for ""required"" files

You would just have have add to your dictionary a list of required files:
checker = {
  ...
  'required': ['file', 'list', 'for_required']
}

As far as there being a better/extensible way to do this?  I am not exactly sure.  I could only really think of a way to possibly drop the ""multiple"" regular expressions and build off of Sven's idea for using a delimiter.  So my strategy would be defining a dictionary as follows (and I'm sorry I don't know Python syntax and I'm a tad to lazy to look it up but it should make sense.  The /regex/ is shorthand for a regex):
check_dict = {
  'delim'    : /\-/,
  'parts'    : [ 'Show Name', 'Episode Name', 'Episode Number' ],
  'patterns' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],
  'required' : ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  'ignored'  : ['.*', 'hidden.txt'],
  'start_dir': '/path/to/dir/to/test/'
}


Split the filename based on the delimiter.
Check each of the parts.

Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn't match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the parts and patterns have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order.
Ignored and required files can be listed.  The . and .. files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input ""globs"" which can be shell expanded.  I'm thinking here of svn:ignore properties, but globbing is natural for listing files.
Here start_dir would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful.
The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for ""valid files"".  I really couldn't come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.  The real problem was that the path template was not composed of parts, which makes sense but adds complexity.
Is this strategy in tune with what you were thinking of?

"
20420,"You sound as if you're looking for three major things: code templates, refactoring tools, and auto-completion.
The good news is that Xcode 3 and later come with superb auto-completion and template support.  By default, you have to explicitly request completion by hitting the escape key.  (This actually works in all NSTextViews; try it!)  If you want to have the completions appear automatically, you can go to Preferences -> Code Sense and set the pop-up to appear automatically after a few seconds.  You should find good completions for C and Objective-C code, and pretty good completions for C++.
Xcode also has a solid template/skeleton system that you can use.  You can see what templates are available by default by going to Edit -> Insert Text Macro.  Of course, you don't want to insert text macros with the mouse; that defeats the point.  Instead, you have two options:

Back in Preferences,go to Key Bindings, and then, under Menu Key Bindings, assign a specific shortcut to macros you use often.  I personally don't bother doing this, but I know plenty of great Mac devs who do
Use the CompletionPrefix.  By default, nearly all of the templates have a special prefix that, if you type and then hit the escape key, will result in the template being inserted.  You can use Control-/ to move between the completion fields.
You can see a full list of Xcode's default macros and their associated CompletionPrefixes at Crooked Spin.
You can also add your own macros, or modify the defaults.  To do so, edit the file /Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/{C,HTML}.xctxtmacro.  The syntax should be self-explanatory, if not terribly friendly.

Unfortunately, if you're addicted to R#, you will be disappointed by your refactoring options.  Basic refactoring is provided within Xcode through the context menu or by hitting Shift-Apple-J.  From there, you can extract and rename methods, promote and demote them through the class hierarchy, and a few other common operations.  Unfortunately, neither Xcode nor any third-party utilities offer anything approaching Resharper, so on that front, you're currently out of luck.  Thankfully, Apple has already demonstrated versions of Xcode in the works that have vastly improved refactoring capabilities, so hopefully you won't have to wait too long before the situation starts to improve.

When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data; values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction.

20910,"I think you should look at Silverlight as a long-term play, just as Microsoft seems to be doing. There's an obvious balance on when to use Silverlight vs. Flash when you're concerned about reach and install base, but here are some reasons Silverlight is a good direction to move in:

Second mover advantage - Just as Microsoft built a ""better Java"" with .NET, they're able to look at how you'd design a RIA plugin from scratch, today. They have the advantage of knowing how people use the web today, something the inventors of Flash could never have accurately guessed. Flash can add features, but they can't realistically chuck the platform and start over.
Developer familiarity - While Silverlight is a new model, it's not entirely unfamiliar to developers. They'll ""get"" the way Silverlight works a lot more quickly than they'll understand firing up a new development environment with a new scripting language and new event paradigms.
Being rid of the timeline model in Flash - Flash was originally built for keyframe based animations, and while there are ways to abstract this away, it's at the core of how Flash works. Silverlight ditches that for an application-centric model. 
ScottGu - ScottGu is fired up about Silverlight. Nuff said.
Cool new features - While Silverlight still has some catching up to do with Flash on some obvious features (like webcam / mic integration, or 3d / graphics acceleration), there are some slick new technologies built in to Silverlight - Deep Zoom is one example. I'm seeing more ""revolutionary"" technologies on the Silverlight side, while Flash seems to be in maintenance mode at this point.

21280,"LINQ is not about SQL. LINQ is about being apply functional programming paradigmns on objects.
LINQ to SQL is an ORM built ontop of the LINQ foundation, but LINQ is much more. I don't use LINQ to SQL, yet I use LINQ all the time.
Take the task of finding the intersection of two lists:
Before LINQ, this tasks requires writing a nested foreach that iterates the small list once for every item in the big list O(N*M), and takes about 10 lines of code.
foreach (int number in list1)

    foreach (int number2 in list2)

21560,"I finally got Multisampling working with my wxWidgets OpenGL program. It's a bit messy right now, but here's how:
wxWidgets doesn't have Multisampling support in their stable releases right now (latest version at this time is 2.8.8). But, it's available as a patch and also through their daily snapshot. (The latter is heartening, since it means that the patch has been accepted and should appear in later stable releases if there are no issues.)
So, there are 2 options:

Download and build from their daily snapshot.
Get the patch for your working wxWidgets installation.

I found the 2nd option to be less cumbersome, since I don't want to disturb my working installation as much as possible. If you don't know how to patch on Windows, see this.
At the very least, for Windows, the patch will modify the following files:
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/msw/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/src/msw/glcanvas.cpp

After patching, recompile the wxWidgets libraries.
To enable multisampling in your wxWidgets OpenGL program, minor changes to the code are required.
An attribute list needs to be passed to the wxGLCanvas constructor:
int attribList[] = {WX_GL_RGBA,
                    WX_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER,
                    WX_GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE, // Multi-sampling
                    WX_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16,
                    0, 0};

If you were already using an attribute list, then add the line with GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE to it. Else, add this attribute list definition to your code.
Then modify your wxGLCanvas constructor to take this attribute list as a parameter:
myGLFrame::myGLFrame    // Derived from wxGLCanvas
(
    wxWindow *parent,
    wxWindowID id,
    const wxPoint& pos,
    const wxSize& size,
    long style,
    const wxString& name
)
: wxGLCanvas(parent, (wxGLCanvas*) NULL, id, pos, size, style, name, attribList)
{
    // ...
}

After the wxGLCanvas element is created, multisampling is turned on by default. To disable or enable it at will, use the related OpenGL calls:
glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
glDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);

Multisampling should now work with the wxWidgets OpenGL program. Hopefully, it should be supported in the stable release of wxWidgets soon, making this information irrelevant :-)

And, last but not least, the best way to find which is best is to generate sample data (as much as you need to be a real scenario) and then create a GIST index, measuring how much time is needed to create the index, insert a new value, execute a sample query.

21870,"These are the items that I consider for the topic of Caching:
MemCached Win32
Velocity
.net Cache
Enterprise Library Caching Application Block
MemCached Win32: Up until recently I have used MemCached Win32.  This is a akin to a web farm (many servers serving the same content for high availability) but it is a cache farm.  This means that you can install it locally on your web server initially if you don't have the resources to go bigger.  Then as you go down the road you can scale horizontally (more servers) or vertically (more hardware).  This is a product that was ported from the original MemCached to work on Windows.  This product has been used extensively in very high traffic sites.  http://lineofthought.com/tools/memcached
Velocity: This is Microsofts answer to products such as MemCached.  MemCached has been out for quite some time, Velocity is in CTP mode.  I must say that from what I have read so far this product will certainly turn my head once it is out.  But I can't bring myself to run big production projects on a CTP product with zero track record.  I have started playing with it though as once it gains momentum MemCached won't even compare for those locked in the windows world!  http://blogs.msdn.com/velocity/
.NET Cache:  There is no reason to discount the standard .NET Cache.  It is built in and ready to use for free and with no (major) set up required.  It offers flexibility by way of offering mechanisms for storing items in local memory, a SINGLE state server, or a centralized database.  Where Velocity steps in is when you need more than a single state server (cache in memory) and don't want to use a slow database for holding your cache.
Enterprise Application Block: I stay away from all of the Enterprise Application Blocks.  They are heavy frameworks that give more than I generally require!  As long as you remember to wrap everything that touches code that is not your own and follow simple rules for coding, stick to any of the other methods over this one!  (just my opinion of course - MySpace leverages as much as they can out of Enterprise Application Blocks!)
You don't have to choose up front!  I generally create a cache wrapper that I communicate with in my code for methods such as Get, Set, Exists, Remove, ListKeys, etc.  This then points to an underlying level of cache abstraction that can point to MemCached, Velocity, or .NET cache.  I use StructureMap (or choose another IoC container) to inject which form of cache I want to use for a given environment.  In my local dev box I might use .NET cache in the session.  In production I generally use MemCached Win 32.  But regardless of how it is set up you can easily swap things around to try each system out to see what works best for you.  You just need to make sure that you application knows as little as possible about how things are cached!  Once this layer of abstraction is in place you can then do things such as run a compression algorithm (gzip) for all the data that is going in and out of cache which would allow you to store 10 times the amount of data in cache. - transparently.
I cover .NET Cache, MemCached Win32, StructureMap, and the appropriate abstractions in my book if you are interested!

Post.count(:conditions => [ ""id NOT IN (?)"", Post.find_read_by(current_user)])

This should go into your Post model to follow best practices of not having finders in the view  or controller 
Post.rb
def self.unread_post_count_for_user(user)
  count(:conditions => [ ""id NOT IN (?)"", Post.find_read_by(user)])
end

Then your view will just be
<%= Post.unread_post_count_for_user(current-user) %>

I actually think this is an interesting question. I'm not sure how useful it is, but it is a valid question.
@Ed
Can you provide a little more info on this question? You said the dimension of the array is dynamic, but is the number of elements dynamic as well?
EDIT: I'm going to try and answer the question anyways. I can't give you the code off the top of my head (it would take a while to get it right without any compiler here on this PC), but I can point you in the right direction ...
Let's use 8 dimensions (0-7) with indexes 0 to 3 as an example. You care about only 1,2 and 6. This means you have two arrays. First, array_care[4][4][4] for 1,2, and 6. The array_care[4][4][4] will hold the end result.
Next, we want to iterate in a very specific way. We have the array input[4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4] to parse through, and we care about dimensions 1, 2, and 6.
We need to define some temporary indexes:
int dim[8] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};

We also need to store the order in which we want to increase the indexes:
int increase_index_order[8] = {7,5,4,3,0,6,2,1};
int i = 0;

This order is important for doing what you requested.
Define a termination flag:
bool terminate=false;

Now we can create our loop:
while (terminate)
{
array_care[dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[6]] += input[dim[0]][dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[3]][dim[4]][dim[5]][dim[6]][dim[7]];

while ((dim[increase_index_order[i]] = 3) && (i < 8))
{
dim[increase_index_order[i]]=0;
i++;
}

if (i < 8) {
dim[increase_index_order[i]]++; i=0;
} else {
terminate=true;
}
}

That should work for 8 dimensions, caring about 3 dimensions. It would take a bit more time to make it dynamic, and I don't have the time. Hope this helps. I apologize, but I haven't learned the code markups yet. :(

23250,"I don't mean this to sound snarky, but it doesn't matter.
Seriously.
Look at the things that are important: your project, your code, your job, your personal life. None of them are going to have their success rest on whether or not you use the ""this"" keyword to qualify access to fields. The this keyword will not help you ship on time. It's not going to reduce bugs, it's not going to have any appreciable effect on code quality or maintainability. It's not going to get you a raise, or allow you to spend less time at the office. 
It's really just a style issue. If you like ""this"", then use it. If you don't, then don't. If you need it to get correct semantics then use it. The truth is, every programmer has his own unique programing style. That style reflects that particular programmer's notions of what the ""most aesthetically pleasing code"" should look like. By definition, any other programmer who reads your code is going to have a different programing style. That means there is always going to be something you did that the other guy doesn't like, or would have done differently. At some point some guy is going to read your code and grumble about something. 
I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else.

23930,"Polyglot: 5 languages, all using bignums
So, I wrote a polyglot which works in the three languages I often write in, as well as one from my other answer to this question and one I just learned today.  It's a standalone program, which reads a single line containing a nonnegative integer and prints a single line containing its factorial.  Bignums are used in all languages, so the maximum computable factorial depends only on your computer's resources.

Perl: uses built-in bignum package.  Run with perl FILENAME.
Haskell: uses built-in bignums.  Run with runhugs FILENAME or your favorite compiler's equivalent.
C++: requires GMP for bignum support.  To compile with g++, use g++ -lgmpxx -lgmp -x c++ FILENAME to link against the right libraries.  After compiling, run ./a.out.  Or use your favorite compiler's equivalent.
brainf*ck: I wrote some bignum support in this post.  Using Muller's classic distribution, compile with bf < FILENAME > EXECUTABLE.  Make the output executable and run it.  Or use your favorite distribution.
Whitespace: uses built-in bignum support.  Run with wspace FILENAME.

Edit: added Whitespace as a fifth language.  Incidentally, do not wrap the code with <code> tags; it breaks the Whitespace.  Also, the code looks much nicer in fixed-width.

I'm only saying the following based on the title and your question, but:
Bear in mind that classes provide the advantage of methods and access control, as well. So if you wanted to ensure that people weren't changing weights to negative numbers, you could make the weight field private and provide some accessor methods, like getWeight() and setWeight(). Inside setWeight(), you could do some value checking, like so:
public function setWeight($weight)
{
    if($weight >= 0)
    {
        $this->weight = $weight;

24270,"
The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed

While this is true and has been observed by other people (take Stepanov, inventor of the STL), the rest is nonsense. OOP may be flawed and it certainly is no silver bullet but it makes large-scale applications much simpler because it's a great way to reduce dependencies. Of course, this is only true for Ã¢ÂÂgoodÃ¢ÂÂ OOP design. Sloppy design won't give any advantage. But good, decoupled design can be modelled very well using OOP and not well using other techniques.
There are much better, more universal models (Haskell's type model comes to mind) but these are also often more complicated and/or difficult to implement efficiently. OOP is a good trade-off between extremes.

I spent some time attempting to rewrite the footer code using DDX as outlined here and the CFPDF tag to implement it; but even after several hours of hacking away and finally getting a valid DDX as reported by the new isDDX function, the CFPDF tag reported that it was invalid DDX for some reason.

which translates to:
xmlNode stuffChild = stuff.SelectSingleNode(""self::node()/descendant::stuffChild"");
xmlNode stuffChild = stuff.SelectSingleNode(""self::node()/descendant-or-self::stuffChild"");

In the case where the child node could have the same name as the parent, you would want to use the slightly more verbose syntax that follows, to ensure that you don't re-select the parent:
xmlNode stuffChild = stuff.SelectSingleNode(""self::node()/descendant::stuffChild"");

Also note that if ""stuffChild"" is a direct descendant of ""stuff"", you can completely omit the prefixes, and just select ""stuffChild"".
XmlNode stuffChild = stuff.SelectSingleNode(""stuffChild"");

Are screen readers really so primitive that they would read text that isn't even displayed on the screen?

What you have to remember is that any HTML parser doesn't read the screen - it reads the source markup. Whta you see on the screen is the browser's attempt to apply CSS to the source code. It's irrelevant.

You could probably even identify parts of the page that are menus or table of contents, and give some sort of easy way for those parts to be read exclusively or skipped over.

You could, if there were a standard for such a thing.
I'm not very hot on the limitations of screen readers, however I've read a lot about them not being ideal. The best thing I can reccommend is to put your source in order - how you'd read it. 
There are a set of CSS properties you should also look at for screen readers.

Every time that the upper cell (B1 on this case) is the same as the current one (B2), the upper row content from column E is returned.

To answer the original question, one way you could do this, and mind you, this is a bit of a hack, simply serialize the two arrays to JSON and then compare the two JSON strings. That would simply tell you if the arrays are different, obviously you could do this to each of the objects within the arrays as well to see which ones were different.
Another option is to use a library which has some nice facilities for comparing objects - I use and recommend MochiKit.

EDIT: The answer kamens gave deserves consideration as well, since a single function to compare two given objects would be much smaller than any library to do what I suggest (although my suggestion would certainly work well enough).
Here is a naÃÂ¯ve implemenation that may do just enough for you - be aware that there are potential problems with this implementation:
function objectsAreSame(x, y) {
   var objectsAreSame = true;
   for(var propertyName in x) {
      if(x[propertyName] !== y[propertyName]) {
         objectsAreSame = false;
         break;
      }
   }
   return objectsAreSame;

The assumption is that both objects have the same exact list of properties.

Is there a way to open file in a non-exclusive way,

Yes, using Win32, passing the various FILE_SHARE_Xxxx flags to CreateFile.

is it cross platform?

No, it requires platform-specific code.
Due to annoying backwards compatibility concerns (DOS applications, being single-tasking, assume that nothing can delete a file out from under them, i.e. that they can fclose() and then fopen() without anything going amiss; Win16 preserved this assumption to make porting DOS applications easier, Win32 preserved this assumption to make porting Win16 applications easier, and it's awful), Windows defaults to opening files exclusively.
The underlying OS infrastructure supports deleting/renaming open files  (although I believe it does have the restriction that memory-mapped files cannot be deleted, which I think isn't a restriction found on *nix), but the default opening semantics do not.
C++ has no notion of any of this; the C++ operating environment is much the same as the DOS operating environment--no other applications running concurrently, so no need to control file sharing.

You would have the following nodes
Key     Name     Parent     Path

4       System32   3        *1*3*4*

Path is indexed, and will allow you to quickly do a query that picks up a node and all its children, without having to manipulate ranges.

WHERE Path LIKE '*1*2*%'

"
27910,"Ok, I'm currently extracting thousands of DOIs from free form text (XML) and I realized that my previous approach had a few problems, namely regarding encoded entities and trailing punctuation, so I went on reading the specification and this is the best I could come with.


The DOI prefix shall be composed of a directory indicator followed by
  a registrant code. These two components shall be separated by a full
  stop (period).
The directory indicator shall be ""10"". The directory indicator
  distinguishes the entire set of character strings (prefix and suffix)
  as digital object identifiers within the resolution system.

Easy enough, the initial \b prevents us from ""matching"" a ""DOI"" that doesn't start with 10.:
$pattern = '\b(10[.]';



The second element of the DOI prefix shall be the registrant code. The
  registrant code is a unique string assigned to a registrant.

Also, all assigned registrant code are numeric, and at least 4 digits long, so:
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}';



The registrant code may be further divided into sub-elements for
  administrative convenience if desired. Each sub-element of the
  registrant code shall be preceded by a full stop.

$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*';



The DOI syntax shall be made up of a DOI prefix and a DOI suffix
  separated by a forward slash.

However, this isn't absolutely necessary, section 2.2.3 states that uncommon suffix systems may use other conventions (such as 10.1000.123456 instead of 10.1000/123456), but lets cut some slack.
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/';



The DOI name is case-insensitive and can incorporate any printable
  characters from the legal graphic characters of Unicode. The DOI
  suffix shall consist of a character string of any length chosen by the
  registrant. Each suffix shall be unique to the prefix element that
  precedes it. The unique suffix can be a sequential number, or it might
  incorporate an identifier generated from or based on another system.

Now this is where it gets trickier, from all the DOIs I have processed, I saw the following characters (besides [0-9a-zA-Z] of course) in their suffixes: .-()/:- -- so, while it doesn't exist, the DOI 10.1016.12.31/nature.S0735-1097(98)2000/12/31/34:7-7 is completely plausible.
The logical choice would be to use \S or the [[:graph:]] PCRE POSIX class, so lets do that:
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/\S+'; // or
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/[[:graph:]]+';


Now we have a difficult problem, the [[:graph:]] class is a super-set of the [[:punct:]] class, which includes characters easily found in free text or any markup language: ""'&<> among others.
Lets just filter the markup ones for now using a negative lookahead:
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/(?:(?![""&\'<>])\S)+'; // or
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/(?:(?![""&\'<>])[[:graph:]])+';


The above should cover encoded entities (&), attribute quotes ([""']) and open / close tags ([<>]).
Unlike markup languages, free text usually doesn't employ punctuation characters unless they are bounded by at least one space or placed at the end of a sentence, for instance:

This is a long DOI:
  10.1016.12.31/nature.S0735-1097(98)2000/12/31/34:7-7!!!

The solution here is to close our capture group and assert another word boundary:
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/(?:(?![""&\'<>])\S)+)\b'; // or
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/(?:(?![""&\'<>])[[:graph:]])+)\b';

And voilÃÂ¡, here is a demo.

28160,"Overwhelmed by thousands lines of code?
Having one set of header/source files per class in a directory can seem overkill. And if the number of classes goes toward 100 or 1000, it can even be frightening.
But having played with sources following the philosophy ""let's put together everything"", the conclusion is that only the one who wrote the file has any hope to not be lost inside. Even with an IDE, it is easy to miss things because when you're playing with a source of 20,000 lines, you just close your mind for anything not exactly refering to your problem.
Real life example: the class hierarchy defined in those thousand lines sources closed itself into a diamond-inheritance, and some methods were overridden in child classes by methods with exactly the same code. This was easily overlooked (who wants to explore/check a 20,000 lines source code?), and when the original method was changed (bug correction), the effect was not as universal as excepted.
Dependancies becoming circular?
I had this problem with templated code, but I saw similar problems with regular C++ and C code.
Breaking down your sources into 1 header per struct/class lets you:

Speed up compilation because you can use symbol forward-declaration instead of including whole objects
Have circular dependencies between classes (ÃÂ§) (i.e. class A has a pointer to B, and B has a pointer to A)

In source-controlled code, class dependencies could lead to regular moving of classes up and down the file, just to make the header compile. You don't want to study the evolution of such moves when comparing the same file in different versions.
Having separate headers makes the code more modular, faster to compile, and makes it easier to study its evolution through different versions diffs
For my template program, I had to divide my headers into two files: The .HPP file containing the template class declaration/definition, and the .INL file containing the definitions of the said class methods.
Putting all this code inside one and only one unique header would mean putting class definitions at the begining of this file, and the method definitions at the end.
And then, if someone needed only a small part of the code, with the one-header-only solution, they still would have to pay for the slower compilation.
(ÃÂ§) Note that you can have circular dependencies between classes if you know which class owns which. This is a discussion about classes having knowledge of the existence of other classes, not shared_ptr circular dependencies antipattern.
One last word: Headers should be self-sufficients
One thing, though, that must be respected by a solution of multiple headers and multiple sources.
When you include one header, no matter which header, your source must compile cleanly.
Each header should be self-sufficient. You're supposed to develop code, not treasure-hunting by greping your 10,000+ source files project to find which header defines the symbol in the 1,000 lines header you need to include just because of one enum.
This means that either each header defines or forward-declare all the symbols it uses, or include all the needed headers (and only the needed headers).

28530,"I recommend the Apache License (specifically, version 2).  It is not a Ã¢ÂÂcopy leftÃ¢ÂÂ license and it addresses several matters that are important to established companies and their lawyers.
Ã¢ÂÂCopy leftÃ¢ÂÂ is the philosophy of the free software foundation requiring anything incorporating the licensed opens source code to also be licensed as open source.  That philosophy is regarded as poison by established companies that want to keep their products proprietary.
Aside from not having Ã¢ÂÂcopy leftÃ¢ÂÂ provisions, the Apache license specifically addresses the grant of rights from project contributors and it expressly addresses the fact that modern companies are typically made up for more than one legal entity (for example, a parent company and its subsidiaries).  Most open source licenses donÃ¢ÂÂt address these points.
Whatever license you choose, if you want your code to be Ã¢ÂÂcorporate friendly,Ã¢ÂÂ in the sense that you want it to be incorporated into commercial, non-open source products, it is essential that you avoid GPL and other Ã¢ÂÂcopy leftÃ¢ÂÂ type licenses.  While it would be best to consult with your own lawyer before investing time or money in a project for which this is an important factor, a quick shorthand for licenses that are and are not Ã¢ÂÂcopy leftÃ¢ÂÂ can be found on the Free Software FoundationÃ¢ÂÂs website.  They identify which licenses they donÃ¢ÂÂt find meet their standards as Ã¢ÂÂcopy left.Ã¢ÂÂ  The ones FSF rejects are most likely the ones that will be corporate friendly in this sense.
(Although the question didnÃ¢ÂÂt ask this, it is worth mentioning that, with very few exceptions, even GPL and other Ã¢ÂÂcopy leftÃ¢ÂÂ type licenses are perfectly corporate friendly if they are only used internally by the commercial entities and not incorporated into their products.)

28590,"Database connections are a limited resource.  Some DBs have a very low connection limit, and wasting connections is a major problem.  By consuming many connections, you may be blocking others for using the database.
Additionally, throwing a ton of extra connections at the DB doesn't help anything unless there are resources on the DB server sitting idle.  If you've got 8 cores and only one is being used to satisfy a query, then sure, making another connection might help.  More likely, though, you are already using all the available cores.  You're also likely hitting the same harddrive for every DB request, and adding additional lock contention.
If your DB has anything resembling high utilization, adding extra connections won't help.  That'd be like spawning extra threads in an application with the blind hope that the extra concurrency will make processing faster.  It might in some certain circumstances, but in other cases it'll just slow you down as you thrash the hard drive, waste time task-switching, and introduce synchronization overhead.

29680,"Mark's comment is correct; The NTLM auth prompt is triggered by a 401 response code and the presence of NTLM as the first mechanism offered in the WWW-Authenticate header (Ref: The NTLM Authentication Protocol).
I'm not sure if I understand the question description correctly, but I think you are trying to wrap the NTLM authentication for SharePoint, which means you don't have control over the server-side authentication protocol, correct? If you're not able to manipulate the server side to avoid sending a 401 response on failed credentials, then you will not be able to avoid this problem, because it's part of the (client-side) spec:
The XMLHttpRequest Object

If the UA supports HTTP Authentication [RFC2617] it SHOULD consider requests
  originating from this object to be part of the protection space that includes the
  accessed URIs and send Authorization  headers and handle 401 Unauthorised requests
  appropriately. if authentication fails, UAs should prompt the users for credentials.

So the spec actually calls for the browser to prompt the user accordingly if any 401 response is received in an XMLHttpRequest, just as if the user had accessed the URL directly. As far as I can tell the only way to really avoid this would be for you to have control over the server side and cause 401 Unauthorized responses to be avoided, as Mark mentioned. 
One last thought is that you may be able to get around this using a proxy, such a separate server side script on another webserver. That script then takes a user and pass parameter and checks the authentication, so that the user's browser isn't what's making the original HTTP request and therefore isn't receiving the 401 response that's causing the prompt. If you do it this way you can find out from your ""proxy"" script if it failed, and if so then prompt the user again until it succeeds. On a successful authentication event, you can simply fetch the HTTP request as you are now, since everything works if the credentials are correctly specified.

This is the ideal circumstance in which to use either an open or closed beta.  It's usually beneficial to start off 'closed' with a group of people you select and trust to bug-find quickly and reliably - after you're more confident that all the critical bugs are gone, open it up with an invite system (for example).
If, however, your application is 'trivial' from a technical standpoint (i.e. it's something like Twitter, or Facebook, or Flickr - nothing that is inherently geared towards technical usage), then you're going to have to be more careful in how you plan your testing.  Closed testing is most definitely your first port of call, and this should last for longer than a closed beta on a more 'technical' product.  The reason?  Your 'average Joe' doesn't necessarily know what the word ""beta"" means, and others may well be scared by it, or judge your service prematurely (not understanding the concept of this 'public testing' phase).  Many won't want to be used as guinea pigs.

There is quite of few steps to encapsulate that logic out.  If that is the road you want to take, I can post code for you.  I am just not sure how practical it would be to post the code here on StackOverflow, but I can give it a shot to keep it concise and to the point.  Otherwise, you are stuck with the tedious task of repeating each expectation on the index accessor for the reader.  The encapsulation process will also get rid of the strings and make those strings more reusable through your tests.
Also, I am not sure at this point how much you want to make the existing code more testable.  Since this is legacy code that wasn't built with testing in mind.

The weaknesses here are that it gets pretty wordy in the body and you're unlikely to be able to get it down to listing a color only once.  But you might be able to do it only two or three times and you can group those colors together, perhaps in their own sheet.  Now when you want to change the color scheme they're all together and the change is pretty simple.

30710,"I would suggest mocking out your calls to the database.  Mocks are basically objects that look like the object you are trying to call a method on, in the sense that they have the same properties, methods, etc. available to caller.  But instead of performing whatever action they are programmed to do when a particular method is called, it skips that altogether, and just returns a result. That result is typically defined by you ahead of time.  
In order to set up your objects for mocking, you probably need to use some sort of inversion of control/ dependency injection pattern, as in the following pseudo-code:
class Bar
{
    private FooDataProvider _dataProvider;

    public instantiate(FooDataProvider dataProvider) {
        _dataProvider = dataProvider;
    }

    public getAllFoos() {
        // instead of calling Foo.GetAll() here, we are introducing an extra layer of abstraction
        return _dataProvider.GetAllFoos();
    }
}

class FooDataProvider
{
    public Foo[] GetAllFoos() {
        return Foo.GetAll();
    }
}

Now in your unit test, you create a mock of FooDataProvider, which allows you to call the method GetAllFoos without having to actually hit the database.
class BarTests
{
    public TestGetAllFoos() {
        // here we set up our mock FooDataProvider
        mockRepository = MockingFramework.new()
        mockFooDataProvider = mockRepository.CreateMockOfType(FooDataProvider);

        // create a new array of Foo objects
        testFooArray = new Foo[] {Foo.new(), Foo.new(), Foo.new()}

        // the next statement will cause testFooArray to be returned every time we call FooDAtaProvider.GetAllFoos,
        // instead of calling to the database and returning whatever is in there
        // ExpectCallTo and Returns are methods provided by our imaginary mocking framework
        ExpectCallTo(mockFooDataProvider.GetAllFoos).Returns(testFooArray)

        // now begins our actual unit test
        testBar = new Bar(mockFooDataProvider)
        baz = testBar.GetAllFoos()

        // baz should now equal the testFooArray object we created earlier
        Assert.AreEqual(3, baz.length)
    }
}

A common mocking scenario, in a nutshell.  Of course you will still probably want to unit test your actual database calls too, for which you will need to hit the database.

So we added a custom behavior to the client that adds the username and (encrypted) password to the message headers, and another custom behavior on the server that verifies them.
All very simple, required no changes to the client side service access layer or the service contract implementation. And as it's all done by configuration, if and when we need to move to something a little stronger it'll be easy to migrate.

31320,"I picked up this technique a while back and have found it quite handy.
When it's in place, you can add ?profile=true to any URL that hits a controller. Your action will run as usual, but instead of delivering the rendered page to the browser, it'll send a detailed, nicely formatted ruby-prof page that shows where your action spent its time.
First, add ruby-prof to your Gemfile, probably in the development group:
group :development do
    gem ""ruby-prof""
end

Then add an around filter to your ApplicationController:
around_filter :profile if Rails.env == 'development'

def profile
  if params[:profile] && result = RubyProf.profile { yield }

    out = StringIO.new
    RubyProf::GraphHtmlPrinter.new(result).print out, :min_percent => 0
    self.response_body = out.string

  else
    yield
  end
end

Reading the ruby-prof output is a bit of an art, but I'll leave that as an exercise.
Additional note by ScottJShea:
If you want to change the measurement type place this:
RubyProf.measure_mode = RubyProf::GC_TIME #example
Before the if in the profile method of the application controller. You can find a list of the available measurements at the ruby-prof page. As of this writing the memory and allocations data streams seem to be corrupted (see defect).

31340,"Yes, because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) there can only run one thread at a time. Here are some links with some insights about this:

http://smoothspan.wordpress.com/2007/09/14/guido-is-right-to-leave-the-gil-in-python-not-for-multicore-but-for-utility-computing/

From the last link an interesting quote:

Let me explain what all that means. 
  Threads run inside the same virtual
  machine, and hence run on the same
  physical machine.  Processes can run
  on the same physical machine or in
  another physical machine.  If you
  architect your application around
  threads, youÃ¢ÂÂve done nothing to access
  multiple machines.  So, you can scale
  to as many cores are on the single
  machine (which will be quite a few
  over time), but to really reach web
  scales, youÃ¢ÂÂll need to solve the
  multiple machine problem anyway.

If you want to use multi core, pyprocessing defines an process based API to do real parallelization. The PEP also includes some interesting benchmarks.
"
31380,"In this case, I would do as you are doing (use a byte array for buffering and not one of the stream buffers).
There are exceptions, though. One place you see buffers (output this time) is in the servlet API. Data isn't written to the underlying stream until flush() is called, allowing you to buffer output but then dump the buffer if an error occurs and write an error page instead. You might buffer input if you needed to reset the stream for rereading using mark(int) and reset(). For example, maybe you'd inspect the file header before deciding on which content handler to pass the stream to.
Unrelated, but I think you should rewrite your stream handling. This pattern works best to avoid resource leaks:
    InputStream stream = new FileInputStream(""in"");
    try { //no operations between open stream and try block
        //work
    } finally { //do nothing but close this one stream in the finally
        stream.close();
    }

If you are opening multiple streams, nest try/finally blocks.
Another thing your code is doing is making the assumption that the returned content is encoded in your VM's default character set (though that might be adequate, depending on the use case).
"
31410,"I saw this functionality in older versions of VS.Net (2003 I think).  It may still exist in current versions, but I haven't encountered it.  Seems that files with the same name, even in different directories confuse VS.Net, and it ends up setting a break point in a file with the same name.  May only happen if the classes in the file both have the same name also.  So much for namespaces I guess.  
You also may want to check your build configuration to make sure that all the projects are in fact building in debug mode.  I know I've been caught a couple times when the configuration got changed somehow for the solution, and some projects weren't compiling in debug mode.

The only breaking change I've seen in my own WPF applications with a new release of the framework was one recently in 3.5 SP1, and that was because we were unknowingly relying on a bug to get a certain behaviour from our code. We adjusted the XAML to be more correct and it started working fine.

31500,"Yeah, that's right.  If your employee table has 10,000 records, and only 5 records have employeetypeID in (1,2,3), then it will most likely use the index to fetch the records.  However, if it finds that 9,000 records have the employeeIDType in (1,2,3), then it would most likely just do a table scan to get the corresponding EmployeeIDs, as it's faster just to run through the whole table than to go to each branch of the index tree and look at the records individually.  
SQL Server does a lot of stuff to try and optimize how the queries run.  However, sometimes it doesn't get the right answer.  If you know that SQL Server isn't using the index, by looking at the execution plan in query analyzer, you can tell the query engine to use a specific index with the following change to your query.
Select EmployeeId From Employee WITH (Index(Index_EmployeeTypeId )) Where EmployeeTypeId IN (1,2,3)

Assuming the index you have on the EmployeeTypeId field is named Index_EmployeeTypeId.

31840,"I'd say you're probably fine with util.logging for the needs you describe.
For a good decision tree, have a look at Log4j vs java.util.logging

Question One :
  Do you anticipate a need for any of the clever handlers that Log4j has that JUL does not have, such as the SMTPHandler, NTEventLogHandler, or any of the very convenient FileHandlers?
Question Two :
  Do you see yourself wanting to frequently switch the format of your logging output? Will you need an easy, flexible way to do so? In other words, do you need Log4j's PatternLayout?
Question Three :
  Do you anticipate a definite need for the ability to change complex logging configurations in your applications, after they are compiled and deployed in a production environment? Does your configuration sound something like, ""Severe messages from this class get sent via e-mail to the support guy; severe messages from a subset of classes get logged to a syslog deamon on our server; warning messages from another subset of classes get logged to a file on network drive A; and then all messages from everywhere get logged to a file on network drive B""? And do you see yourself tweaking it every couple of days?
If you can answer yes to any of the above questions, go with Log4j. If you answer a definite no to all of them, JUL will be more than adequate and it's conveniently already included in the SDK.

That said, pretty much every project these days seems to wind up including log4j, if only because some other library uses it.

32010,"Yes, [A-Za-z] will be much faster than setting the RegexOptions.IgnoreCase, largely because of Unicode strings. But it's also much more limiting -- [A-Za-z] does not match accented international characters, it's literally the A-Za-z ASCII set and nothing more.
I don't know if you saw Tim Bray's answer to my message, but it's a good one:

One of the trickiest issues in internationalized search is upper and lower case. This notion of case is limited to languages written in the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets. English-speakers naturally expect search to be case-insensitive if only because theyÃ¢ÂÂre lazy: if Nadia Jones wants to look herself up on Google sheÃ¢ÂÂll probably just type in nadia jones and expect the system to take care of it.
So itÃ¢ÂÂs fairly common for search systems to Ã¢ÂÂnormalizeÃ¢ÂÂ words by converting them all to lower- or upper-case, both for indexing and queries.
The trouble is that the mapping between cases is not always as straightforward as it is in English. For example, the German lower-case character Ã¢ÂÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂ becomes Ã¢ÂÂSSÃ¢ÂÂ when upper-cased, and good old capital Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂ when down-cased in Turkish becomes the dotless Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ±Ã¢ÂÂ (yes, they have Ã¢ÂÂiÃ¢ÂÂ, its upper-case version is Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ°Ã¢ÂÂ). I have read (but not verified first-hand) that the rules for upcasing accented characters such Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ©Ã¢ÂÂ are different in France and QuÃÂ©bec. One of the results of all this is that software such as java.String.toLowerCase() tends to run astonishingly slow as it tries to work around all these corner-cases.

32550,"According to Kalen Delaney...
The NOLOCK hint has nothing to do with the index options. The hint tells SQL
Server not to request locks when doing SELECT operations, so there will be
no conflict with data that is already locked. The index options just tell
SQL Server that this level of locking is allowed, when locking is going to
occur. For example, if ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS was off, the only possible locks
would be page or table locks. The index options don't force locks to be
held, they just control the possible size of the locks.
In answer to the question in your subject, the NOLOCK hint and the

Note the data context is disconnected. The connection is only made when the query data is enumerated (not when you first run the query, it's a 'lazy' data type so only provides data when it's needed), and then closed immediately afterwards. On .SubmitChanges() the connection is opened to submit the changes then closed immediately afterwards. So don't think keeping the datacontext around keeps a connection open, it doesn't (you can hook the StateChange event of the connection to confirm this for yourself, that's how I'm sure).

34020,"Python threads are good for concurrent I/O programming. Threads are swapped out of the CPU as soon as they block waiting for input from file, network, etc. This allows other Python threads to use the CPU while others wait. This would allow you to write a multi-threaded web server or web crawler, for example.
However, Python threads are serialized by the GIL when they enter interpreter core. This means that if two threads are crunching numbers, only one can run at any given moment. It also means that you can't take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor architectures.
There are solutions like running multiple Python interpreters concurrently, using a C based threading library. This is not for the faint of heart and the benefits might not be worth the trouble. Let's hope for an all Python solution in a future release.

34510,"A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are ""racing"" to access/change the data. 
Problems often occur when one thread does a ""check-then-act"" (e.g. ""check"" if the value is X, then ""act"" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the ""check"" and the ""act"". E.g:
if (x == 5) // The ""Check""
{
   y = x * 2; // The ""Act""

   // If another thread changed x in between ""if (x == 5)"" and ""y = x * 2"" above,
   // y will not be equal to 10.
}

The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing.
In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time. This would mean something like this:
// Obtain lock for x
if (x == 5)
{
   y = x * 2; // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released. 
              // Therefore y = 10
}
// release lock for x

The important thing to determine for yourself is whether or not a library will fit your particular style and sensibilities. Wide-spread ignorance about how JavaScript, the language, actually works, coupled with the negative press resulting thereby, coupled with the now-immense popularity of jQuery leads most people down that road.

35170,"""automatic"" does in fact mean ""re-entrant"".  The term itself is stolen from software languages -- for example, C has the ""auto"" keyword for declaring variables as being allocated on the stack when the scope it's in is executed, and deallocated afterwards, so that multiple invocations of the same scope do not see persistent values of that variable.  The reason you may not have heard of this keyword in C is that it is the default storage class for all types :-)  The alternatives are ""static"", which means ""allocate this variable statically (to a single global location in memory), and refer to this same memory location throughout the execution of the program, regardless of how many times the function is invoked"", and ""volatile"", which means ""this is a register elsewhere on my SoC or something on another device which I have no control over; compiler, please don't optimize reads to me away, even when you think you know my value from previous reads with no intermediate writes in the code"".
""automatic"" is intended for recursive functions, but also for running the same function in different threads of execution concurrently.  For instance, if you ""fork"" off N different blocks (using Verilog's fork->join statement), and have them all call the same function at the same time, the same problems arise as a function calling itself recursively.
In many cases, your code will be just fine without declaring the task or function as ""automatic"", but it's good practice to put it in there unless you specifically need it to be otherwise.

35420,"To monitor the servers we use the free tools from Maatkit ... simple, yet efficient.
The binary replication is available in 5.1, so I guess you've got some balls. We still use 5.0 and it works OK, but of course we had our share of issues with it.
We use a Master-Master replication with a MySql Proxy as a load-balancer in front, and to prevent it from having errors:

we removed all unique indexes
for the few cases where we really needed unique constraints we made sure we used REPLACE instead of INSERT (MySql Proxy can be used to guard for proper usage ... it can even rewrite your queries)
scheduled scripts doing intensive reports are always accessing the same server (not the load-balancer) ... so that dangerous operations are replicated safely

35490,"MPI was deisgned tightly-coupled compute clusters with fast, reliable networks.  Spread and ÃÂMQ are designed for large distributed systems.  If you're designing a parallel scientific application, go with MPI, but if you are designing a persistent distributed system that needs to be resilient to faults and network instability, use one of the others.
MPI has very limited facilities for fault tolerance; the default error handling behavior in most implementations is a system-wide fail.  Also, the semantics of MPI require that all messages sent eventually be consumed.  This makes a lot of sense for simulations on a  cluster, but not for a distributed application.
"
35530,"Here is how you implement a low-pass filter using convolution:
double[] signal = (some 1d signal);
double[] filter = [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25]; // box-car filter
double[] result = new double[signal.Length + filter.Length + 1];

// Set result to zero:
for (int i=0; i < result.Length; i++) result[i] = 0;

// Do convolution:
for (int i=0; i < signal.Length; i++) 
  for (int j=0; j < filter.Length; j++)
    result[i+j] = result[i+j] + signal[i] * filter[j];

Note that the example is extremely simplified. It does not do range checks and does not handle the edges properly. The filter used (box-car) is a particularly bad lowpass filter, because it will cause a lot of artifacts (ringing). Read up on filter design.
You can also implement the filters in the frequency domain. Here is how you implement a high-pass filter using FFT:
double[] signal = (some 1d signal);
// Do FFT:
double[] real;
double[] imag;
[real, imag] = fft(signal)

// Set the first quarter of the real part to zero to attenuate the low frequencies
for (int i=0; i < real.Length / 4; i++) 
  real[i] = 0;

// Do inverse FFT:
double[] highfrequencysignal = inversefft(real, imag);

Again, this is simplified, but you get the idea. The code does not look as complicated as the math.

35670,"Eric Sink has an excellent series on source code control aimed at beginners. For Subversion specifics, including setting up and administering a server, the Subversion book is a great resource, and includes a section with examples of a typical session with Subversion (checkout, commit, merging and updating basics).
Update: I forgot to mention that for beginners, I'd also recommend messing around in a graphical client, which removes the command-line hassle from the learning experience. RapidSVN is a reasonable cross-platform client. You'll also find that common IDEs either come with Subversion support, or have plugins which can be installed, which allow most version control operations to be performed within that environment.
@John Millikin: While setting up a Subversion server can be complicated, depending on one's general admin experience, don't forget that you don't need to do that just to mess about with a repository and get to grips with the basics - the client can interact with a repository in the local filesystem.

35700,"I maintained for a number of years an ANSI C networking library that was ported to close to 30 different OS's and compilers.  The library didn't have any GUI components, which made it easier.  We ended up abstracting out into dedicated source files any routine that was not consistent across platforms, and used #defines where appropriate in those source files.  This kept the code that was adjusted per platform isolated away from the main business logic of the library.  We also made extensive use of typedefs and our own dedicated types so that we could easily change them per platform if needed.  This made the port to 64-bit platforms fairly easy.
If you are looking to have GUI components, I would suggest looking at GUI toolkits such as WxWindows or Qt (which are both C++ libraries).

35870,"I did this once for a web site.  I.e. find the dealer within 50 miles of your zip code.  I used the great circle calculation to find the coordinates that were 50 miles north, 50 miles east, 50 miles south, and 50 miles west.  That gave me a min and max lat and a min and max long.  From there then I did a database query: 
select *
    from dealers
    where latitude  >= minlat
      and latitude  <= maxlat
      and longitude >= minlong
      and longitude <= maxlong

Since some of those results will still be more than 50 miles away, then I used the great circle formula once more on that small list of coordinates.  Then I printed out the list along with the distance from the target.
Of course, if you wanted to search for points near the international date line or the poles, than this won't work.  But it works great for searches inside North America!

You can load libraries, test code directly, anything you can do with Ruby you can do in this shell.  Believe me, there is quite a lot that you can do with it to improve your Ruby development workflow [1].
ri - Quick shell access to Ruby documentation.  You can find the RDoc information on nearly any Ruby Class or method.  The same kind of documentation that you would find on the online ruby-docs.
erb - Evaluates embedded Ruby in Ruby Templated documents.  Embedded Ruby is just like embedding php into a document, and this is an interpreter for that kind of document.  This is really more for the rails crowd.  An alternative would be haml.
rdoc - Generate the standard Ruby documentation for one of your Ruby classes.  Its like Javadocs.  It parses the Ruby source files and generates the standard documentation from special comments.

37070,"Non-Temporal SSE instructions (MOVNTI, MOVNTQ, etc.), don't follow the normal cache-coherency rules. Therefore non-temporal stores must be followed by an SFENCE instruction in order for their results to be seen by other processors in a timely fashion.
When data is produced and not (immediately) consumed again, the fact that memory store operations read a full cache line first and then modify the cached data is detrimental to performance. This operation pushes data out of the caches which might be needed again in favor of data which will not be used soon. This is especially true for large data structures, like matrices, which are filled and then used later. Before the last element of the matrix is filled the sheer size evicts the first elements, making caching of the writes ineffective.
For this and similar situations, processors provide support for non-temporal write operations. Non-temporal in this context means the data will not be reused soon, so there is no reason to cache it. These non-temporal write operations do not read a cache line and then modify it; instead, the new content is directly written to memory.

39910,"I'm not entirely sure I understand your question, especially the bit about displaying two SPField collections. Sorry if this turns out to be the answer to a completely different question!
Anyway here's a quick demo walkthrough of using the MultipleLookupField in a web part.
Create a team site. Add a few tasks to the task list. Also put a document in the Shared Documents library. Create a new column in the Shared Documents library; call it ""Related"", have it be a Lookup into the Title field of the Tasks list, and allow multiple values.
Now create a web part, do all the usual boilerplate and then add this:
Label l;
MultipleLookupField mlf;

protected override void CreateChildControls()
{
    base.CreateChildControls();
    SPList list = SPContext.Current.Web.Lists[""Shared Documents""];
    if (list != null && list.Items.Count > 0)
    {
        LiteralControl lit = new LiteralControl(""Associate tasks to "" + 
                             list.Items[0].Name);
        this.Controls.Add(lit);

        mlf = new MultipleLookupField();
        mlf.ControlMode = SPControlMode.Edit;
        mlf.FieldName = ""Related"";
        mlf.ItemId = list.Items[0].ID;
        mlf.ListId = list.ID;
        mlf.ID = ""Related"";
        this.Controls.Add(mlf);

        Button b = new Button();
        b.Text = ""Change"";
        b.Click += new EventHandler(bClick);
        this.Controls.Add(b);

        l = new Label();
        this.Controls.Add(l);
    }

}

void bClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    l.Text = """";
    foreach (SPFieldLookupValue val in (SPFieldLookupValueCollection)mlf.Value)
    {
        l.Text += val.LookupValue.ToString() + "" "";
    }
    SPListItem listitem = mlf.List.Items[0];
    listitem[""Related""] = mlf.Value;
    listitem.Update();
    mlf.Value = listitem[""Related""];
}

protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnInit(e);
    EnsureChildControls();
}

Granted, this is borderline ridiculous -- everything is hard-coded, there is no error-handling at all, and it serves no useful purpose -- but it's only meant as a quick demo. Now build and deploy this web part and add an instance of it to your team site's homepage; it should allow you to get and set the tasks which are associated with the first document in the library.
The strange bit towards the end of the button Click handler, where we read a value from mlf.Value and then write it back again, appears to be required if you want the UI to stay in sync with the actual list values. Try omitting the last line of bClick to see what I mean. This has been driving me nuts for the last hour or so, and I'm hoping another commenter can come up with a better approach...

"
40090,"Just to satisfy some curiosity:
From Why doesn't C# support default parameters?:

In languages such as C++, a default value can be included as part of the method declaration:
void Process(Employee employee, bool bonus = false)
This method can be called either with:
a.Process(employee, true);
or
a.Process(employee);
in the second case, the parameter bonus is set to false.
C# doesn't have this feature.
One reason we don't have this feature is related to a specific implementation of the feature. In the C++ world, when the user writes:
a.Process(employee);
the compiler generates
a.process(employee, false);
In other words, the compiler takes the default value that is specified in the method prototype and puts it into the method call - it's just as if the user wrote 'false' as the second parameter. There's no way to change that default value without forcing the user of the class to recompile, which is unfortunate.
The overloading model works better in this respect. The framework author just defines two separate methods, and the single-parameter one calls the two-parameter method. This keeps the default value in the framework, where it can be modified if necessary.
It would be possible for a compiler to take something like the C++ definition and produce the overloads, but there are a few issues with that approach.
The first one is that the correlation between the code that the user writes and the code the compiler generates is less obvious. We generally try to limit magic when possible, as it makes it harder for programmers. The second issue has to do with things like XML doc comments and intellisense. The compiler would have to have special rules for how it generates doc comments for the overloaded methods, and intellisense would need to have smarts to collapse the overloaded methods into a single method.
Writing overloads yourself is a bit less convenient, but we think it's an acceptable solution. 

"
40230,"Using Guids as primary keys is acceptable and is considered a fairly standard practice for the same reasons that you are considering them.  They can be overused which can make things a bit tedious to debug and manage, so try to keep them out of code tables and other reference data if at all possible.
The thing that you have to concern yourself with is the human readable identifier.  Guids cannot be exchanged by people - can you imagine trying to confirm your order number over the phone if it is a guid?  So in an offline scenario you may still have to generate something - like a publisher (workstation/user) id and some sequence number, so the order number may be 123-5678 -.  
However this may not satisfy business requirements of having a sequential number.  In fact regulatory requirements can be and influence - some regulations (SOX maybe) require that invoice numbers are sequential.  In such cases it may be neccessary to generate a sort of proforma number which is fixed up later when the systems synchronise.  You may land up with tables having OrderId (Guid), OrderNo (int), ProformaOrderNo (varchar) - some complexity may creep in.
At least having guids as primary keys means that you don't have to do a whole lot of cascading updates when the sync does eventually happen - you simply update the human readable number.
"
40480,"Java is always pass-by-value. Unfortunately, they decided to call pointers references, thus confusing newbies. Because those references are passed by value.
It goes like this:
public static void main( String[] args ){
    Dog aDog = new Dog(""Max"");
    foo(aDog);

    if (aDog.getName().equals(""Max"")) { //true
        System.out.println( ""Java passes by value."" );

    } else if (aDog.getName().equals(""Fifi"")) {
        System.out.println( ""Java passes by reference."" );
    }
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(""Max""); // true

    d = new Dog(""Fifi"");
    d.getName().equals(""Fifi""); // true
}

In this example aDog.getName() will still return ""Max"". The value aDog within main is not overwritten in the function foo with the Dog ""Fifi"" as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the aDog.getName() in main would return ""Fifi"" after the call to foo.
Likewise:
Dog aDog = new Dog(""Max"");
foo(aDog);
aDog.getName().equals(""Fifi""); // true
public void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(""Max""); // true
    d.setName(""Fifi"");
}

In the above example, FiFi is the dog's name after call to foo(aDog). Any operations that foo performs on d are such that, for all practical purposes, they are performed on aDog itself (except d=new Dog(""Boxer"")).

41050,"I wouldn't cache the connection object, that will defeat the built-in connection pooling -- ADO.NET will handle connections (assuming you instantiate and close them) efficiently by itself.

"
41220,"No offense, but the question is a little ""misguided"". There is no ""silver bullet"" solution. I would recommend to read up on cryptography in general and then do some threat modeling. Some questions (by no means a comprehensive list) you should ask yourself:

Is the module doing the encryption the one which needs to decrypt it (in this case use symmetric crypto) or will it send data to an other module (on an other machine) which will use it (in which case you should consider public-key crypto)
What do you want to protect against? Someone accessing the database but not having the sourcecode (in which case you can hardcode the encryption key directly into the source)? Someone sniffing your local network (you should consider transparent solutions like IPSec)? Someone stealing your server (it can happen even in data centers - in which case full disk encryption should be considered)?
Do you really need to keep the data? Can't you directly pass it to the credit card processor and erase it after you get the confirmation? Can't you store it locally at the client in a cookie or Flash LSO? If you store it at the client, make sure that you encrypt it at the server side before putting it in a cookie. Also, if you are using cookies, make sure that you make them http only.
Is it enough to compare the equality of the data (ie the data that the client has given me is the same data that I have)? If so, consider storing a hash of it. Because credit card numbers are relatively short and use a reduced set of symbols, a unique salt should be generated for each before hashing.

Later edit: note that standard encryption algorithms from the same category (for example 3DES and AES - both being symmetric block cyphers) are of comparable strength. Most (commercial) systems are not broken because somebody bruteforced their encryption, but because their threat modelling was not detailed enough (or flat out they didn't have any). For example you can encrypt all the data, but if you happen to have a public facing web interface which is vulnerable to SQL injection, it won't help you much.

41300,"I use EmacsW32, it works great. EDIT: I now use regular GNU Emacs 24, see below.
See its EmacsWiki page for details.
To me, the biggest advantage is that:

it has a version of emacsclient that starts the Emacs server if no server is running (open all your files in the same Emacs window)
it includes several useful packages such as Nxml
it has a Windows installer or you can build it from sources

And concerning XEmacs, according to this post by Steve Yegge:

To summarize, I've argued that XEmacs has a much lower market share, poorer performance, more bugs, much lower stability, and at this point probably fewer features than GNU Emacs. When you add it all up, it's the weaker candidate by a large margin.

EDIT: I now use regular GNU Emacs 24. It also contains Nxml, can be installed or built from sources, and with this wrapper, the Emacs server starts if no server is running. Cheers!

41320,"What you need is source control.
You should definitely not open the same files over the network on multiple machines. For one thing, Visual Studio has safeguards in place to prevent you from modifying certain files during a build, but it has none of that that will prevent others from modifying the same files over the network.
By setting up source control, each developer will have a separate copy of the files locally on his or her developer machine, and periodically communicate with the source control system to check in/commit changes. After that, other developers can ask for the latest updates when they're ready to retrieve them.

The link that appears to be most promising (www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles) is no longer available, so you'll need to poke through the Archive.org version to read it.
At the end of the day the bootloader takes the machine code of the kernel, puts it in memory, and jumps to it.  You can put any machine code in the kernel that you want, but most C programs expect an OS so you'll need to tell your compiler that it won't have all that, or the bootloader has to create some of it.
The kernel then does all the heavy lifting, and I suspect it's the example kernel you want.  But there's a long way to go between having a kernel that says, ""Hello world"" to having a kernel that loads a command interpretor, provides disk services, and loads and manages programs.
You might want to consider subscribing to ACM to get access to their older literature - there are lots of articles in the late 80's and early 90's in early computing magazines about how to create alternative OSs.  There are likely books that are out of print from this era as well.  You might be able to get the same information for free by looking up the indexes of those magazines (which are available on that site - click ""index"" near the magazine name) and then asking around for people with a copy.

43320,"Briefly:

Always use transactions
Don't use Close(), instead wrap your calls on an ISession inside a using statement or manage the lifecycle of your ISession somewhere else.

From the documentation:

From time to time the ISession will execute the SQL statements needed to synchronize the ADO.NET connection's state with the state of objects held in memory. This process, flush, occurs by default at the following points

from some invocations of Find() or Enumerable()
from NHibernate.ITransaction.Commit()
from ISession.Flush() 

The SQL statements are issued in the following order

all entity insertions, in the same order the corresponding objects were saved using ISession.Save()
all entity updates
all collection deletions
all collection element deletions, updates and insertions
all collection insertions
all entity deletions, in the same order the corresponding objects were deleted using ISession.Delete()

(An exception is that objects using native ID generation are inserted when they are saved.)
Except when you explicity Flush(), there are absolutely no guarantees about when the Session executes the ADO.NET calls, only the order in which they are executed. However, NHibernate does guarantee that the ISession.Find(..) methods will never return stale data; nor will they return the wrong data.
It is possible to change the default behavior so that flush occurs less frequently. The FlushMode class defines three different modes: only flush at commit time (and only when the NHibernate ITransaction API is used), flush automatically using the explained routine, or never flush unless Flush() is called explicitly. The last mode is useful for long running units of work, where an ISession is kept open and disconnected for a long time.

...
Also refer to this section:

Ending a session involves four distinct phases:

flush the session
commit the transaction
close the session
handle exceptions 

Flushing the Session
If you happen to be using the ITransaction API, you don't need to worry about this step. It will be performed implicitly when the transaction is committed. Otherwise you should call ISession.Flush() to ensure that all changes are synchronized with the database.
Committing the database transaction
If you are using the NHibernate ITransaction API, this looks like:
tx.Commit(); // flush the session and commit the transaction

If you are managing ADO.NET transactions yourself you should manually Commit() the ADO.NET transaction.
sess.Flush();
currentTransaction.Commit();

If you decide not to commit your changes:
tx.Rollback();  // rollback the transaction

or:
currentTransaction.Rollback();

If you rollback the transaction you should immediately close and discard the current session to ensure that NHibernate's internal state is consistent.
Closing the ISession
A call to ISession.Close() marks the end of a session. The main implication of Close() is that the ADO.NET connection will be relinquished by the session.
tx.Commit();
sess.Close();

sess.Flush();
currentTransaction.Commit();
sess.Close();

If you provided your own connection, Close() returns a reference to it, so you can manually close it or return it to the pool. Otherwise Close() returns it to the pool.

43870,"Update as of PostgreSQL 9.0:
Recent versions of Postgres (since late 2010) have the string_agg(expression, delimiter) function that will do exactly what the question asked for, even letting you specify the delimiter string:
SELECT company_id, string_agg(employee, ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;

Update as of PostgreSQL 8.4:
PostgreSQL 8.4 (in 2009) introduced the aggregate function array_agg(expression) which concatenates the values into an array. Then array_to_string() can be used to give the desired result:
SELECT company_id, array_to_string(array_agg(employee), ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;

Original Answer (for pre-8.4 PostgreSQL):
There is no built-in aggregate function to concatenate strings. It seems like this would be needed, but it's not part of the default set. A web search however reveals some manual implementations the same example:
CREATE AGGREGATE textcat_all(
  basetype    = text,
  sfunc       = textcat,
  stype       = text,
  initcond    = ''
);

Here is the CREATE AGGREGATE documentation.
In order to get the "", "" inserted in between them without having it at the end, you might want to make your own concatenation function and substitute it for the ""textcat"" above. Here is one I put together but haven't tested (update: tested on 8.3.12 and working fine):
CREATE FUNCTION commacat(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;
    END IF;
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

Note: The function above will output a comma even if the value in the row is null/empty, which outputs:
a, b, c, , e, , g

If you would prefer to remove extra commas to output:
a, b, c, e, g

just add an ELSIF check to the function:
CREATE FUNCTION commacat_ignore_nulls(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSIF instr IS NULL OR instr = '' THEN
      RETURN acc;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;

CruiseControl detects the change and builds the new code and drops into Dev.
Developer is able to test the change in a enviroment that mirrors production.
This repeats until all changes are done and tested. 
A script is ran that copies Dev to Test.
Dev is now frozen while business owners UAT on the Test enviroment. If a defect is found, it is fixed in dev and then promoted back to Test.

43940,"SQL Server 2000 doesn't officially support custom aggregate functions.  However, I recently needed that functionality as well, and I found this article enlightening:
http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/jeffs/articles/1490.aspx
It's a bit hack-ish, though: it requires access to the sp_OA___ extended procedures.
The summary is that you can simulate an aggregate function with a series of four wrapper functions, each of which performs one of the following tasks:

Create an ActiveX object that can hold state within the query. Call this before running the query.
Do the actual aggregation using the ActiveX object.
Clear the ActiveX object state on GROUP BY boundries
Destroy the object.  Call this after running the query and during error handling.

You then include items 2 and 3 in the select list for your query, and item 2 must also be wrapped in an existing no-effect aggregate function like MAX() or MIN().  You can also use this technique for cumulative functions to do things like row numbers.
Some of the comments suggest that the optimizer may try to negate the aggregation effects by optimizing away the calls in some circumstances, though I expect that would be a very rare case indeed.  However, I found this question because I took those warnings seriously enough to continue searching for something better.

Edit /etc/mail/sendmail.mc to include the line:
  define(`SMART_HOST',`mailrelay.example.com')dnl

After changing the sendmail.mc macro configuration file, it must be recompiled
to produce the sendmail configuration file.
  # m4 /etc/mail/sendmail.mc > /etc/sendmail.cf

And restart the sendmail service (Linux):
  # /etc/init.d/sendmail restart

As well as setting the smarthost, you might want to also disable name resolution configuration and possibly shift your sendmail to non-standard port, or disable daemon mode.
Disable Name Resolution
Servers that are within fire-walled networks or using Network Address
Translation (NAT) may not have DNS or NIS services available. This creates
a problem for sendmail, since it will use DNS by default, and if it is not
available you will see messages like this in mailq:
  host map: lookup (mydomain.com): deferred)

Unless you are prepared to setup an appropriate DNS or NIS service that
sendmail can use, in this situation you will typically configure name
resolution to be done using the /etc/hosts file. This is done by enabling
a 'service.switch' file and specifying resolution by file, as follows:
1: Enable service.switch for sendmail
Edit /etc/mail/sendmail.mc to include the lines:
  define(`confSERVICE_SWITCH_FILE',`/etc/mail/service.switch')dnl

2: Configure service.switch for files
Create or modify /etc/mail/service.switch to refer only to /etc/hosts for name
resolution:
  # cat /etc/mail/service.switch
  hosts files

3: Recompile sendmail.mc and restart sendmail for this setting to take effect.
Shift sendmail to non-standard port, or disable daemon mode
By default, sendmail will listen on port 25. You may want to change this port
or disable the sendmail daemon mode altogether for various reasons:
- if there is a security policy prohibiting the use of well-known ports
- if another SMTP product/process is to be running on the same host on the standard port
- if you don't want to accept mail via smtp at all, just send it using sendmail
1: To shift sendmail to use non-standard port.
Edit /etc/mail/sendmail.mc and modify the ""Port"" setting in the line:
  DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA')

For example, to get sendmail to use port 125:
  DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=125,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA')

This will require sendmail.mc to be recompiled and sendmail to be restarted.
2: Alternatively, to disable sendmail daemon mode altogether (Linux)
Edit /etc/sysconfig/sendmail and modify the ""DAEMON"" setting to:
  DAEMON=no

This change will require sendmail to be restarted.

So if you don't have any asp.net ajax components in the target container for the response, it would be basically the same as an inner html replacement with any other js framework / ajax request, so i would say that it's just the how the browser handles this, rather than asp.net ajax causing this.
Also, while it may be ""leaking"", it may be by design, meaning that the browser might not have reclaimed the dom elements yet and released them. Also, drip might be causing those to leak, as it is attaching to those dom elements.

44470,"We use Team Foundation Server Team Build and have added a block to the TFSBuild.proj's AfterCompile target to trigger the ClickOnce publish with our preferred version number:
<MSBuild Projects=""$(SolutionRoot)\MyProject\Myproject.csproj""
         Properties=""PublishDir=$(OutDir)\myProjectPublish\;
                     ApplicationVersion=$(PublishApplicationVersion);
                     Configuration=$(Configuration);Platform=$(Platform)""
         Targets=""Publish"" />

The PublishApplicationVersion variable is generated by a custom MSBuild task to use the TFS Changeset number, but you could use your own custom task or an existing solution to get the version number from the AssemblyInfo file.
This could theoretically be done in your project file (which is just an MSBuild script anyway), but I'd recommend against deploying from a developer machine.
I'm sure other continuous integration (CI) solutions can handle this similarly.

Edit: Sorry, got your question backwards. Going from the ClickOnce version number to the AssemblyInfo file should be doable. I'm sure the MSBuild Community Tasks (link above) have a task for updating the AssemblyInfo file, so you'd just need a custom task to pull the version number from the ClickOnce configuration XML.
However, you may also consider changing your error reporting to include the ClickOnce publish version too:
if (System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.IsNetworkDeployed)
{
    Debug.WriteLine(System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.
                                                        CurrentDeployment.CurrentVersion);

44630,"You can use various ways to handle this situation, depending on your source control system. 
Private branches: Allow you to check in and work on code while you go, merging back and forth at appropriate times.
Shelvesets/pacakaged changesets: Allow you to store changesets and send them around for review - ensuring they're production ready before check in.
As to whether this is an appropriate way to work, we don't allow check-in to main branches without prior review. To pass review your code must pass various automated tools, and then must be acceptable to your peer reviewer. For some definitions of ""production ready"" - this is it. Therefore, we do something like what you do. However, we use private branches to ensure that check-ins can still be made while this is in progress, and that other check-ins don't have to interfere. 
If production ready means tested in an integration environment, then it sounds like you may need staging branches or something similar.

45230,"Another way to go would be to use ssh tunneling (which happens on the client side).
You'd do an ssh command like this:

That connects you to the machine that's accessible from the outside (myoutsideserver) and creates a tunnel through that ssh connection to port 22 (the standard ssh port) on the server that's only accessible from the inside.
Then you'd do another ssh command like this (leaving the first one still connected):
ssh -p 8022 paul@localhost

That connection to port 8022 on your localhost will then get tunneled through the first ssh connection taking you over myinsideserver.

There may be something you have to do on myoutsideserver to allow forwarding of the ssh port.  I'm double-checking that now.
Edit
Hmmm.  The ssh manpage says this:  **Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  **
That sort of implies to me that the first ssh connection has to be as root.  Maybe somebody else can clarify that.
It looks like superuser privileges aren't required as long as the forwarded port (in this case, 8022) isn't a privileged port (like 22).  Thanks for the clarification Mike Stone.

45340,"This example uses ASP.NET Routing to implement friendly URLs.  
Examples of the mappings that the application handles are:  
http://samplesite/userid/1234 - http://samplesite/users.aspx?userid=1234
http://samplesite/userid/1235 - http://samplesite/users.aspx?userid=1235 
This example uses querystrings and avoids any requirement to modify the code on the aspx page.  
Step 1 - add the necessary entries to web.config
<system.web>
<compilation debug=""true"">
    	<assemblies>
    		Ã¢ÂÂ¦
    		<add assembly=""System.Web.Routing, Version=3.5.0.0,    Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31BF3856AD364E35""/>

    </handlers>
</system.webServer>

Step 2 - add a routing table in global.asax
Define the mapping from the friendly URL to the aspx page, saving the requested userid for later use.  
void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
}

public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
    routes.Add(""UseridRoute"", new Route
    (
       ""userid/{userid}"",
       new CustomRouteHandler(""~/users.aspx"")
    ));
}

Step 3 - implement the route handler
Add the querystring to the current context before the routing takes place.  
using System.Web.Compilation;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Routing;

public class CustomRouteHandler : IRouteHandler
{
    public CustomRouteHandler(string virtualPath)
    {
        this.VirtualPath = virtualPath;
    }

    public string VirtualPath { get; private set; }

    public IHttpHandler GetHttpHandler(RequestContext
          requestContext)
    {
        // Add the querystring to the URL in the current context
        string queryString = ""?userid="" + requestContext.RouteData.Values[""userid""];
        HttpContext.Current.RewritePath(
          string.Concat(
          VirtualPath,
          queryString)); 

        var page = BuildManager.CreateInstanceFromVirtualPath
             (VirtualPath, typeof(Page)) as IHttpHandler;
        return page;
    }
}

Code from users.aspx
The code on the aspx page for reference.  
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    string id = Page.Request.QueryString[""userid""];
    switch (id)
    {
        case ""1234"":
            lblUserId.Text = id;
            lblUserName.Text = ""Bill"";

45400,"I would use Subversion (in fact I use it) [update: Jul 2014 -- I use Git -- see end of the answer].
SVN is:

free,  
good enough (see disadvantages below),  
simple,  
works fine on Windows (and Linux too), 
a lot of people use it so it's easy to get help, 
can integrate with most of IDEs i.e. Visual Studio (i.e. ankhsvn or VisualSVN -- more info) or Eclipse (i.e. Subclipse -- here someone asked about that).

I would strongly recommended separate machine to source control server. At best somewhere on the cloud. Advantages:

You don't lost your source control repositories if your development box dies.
You don't have to worry about maintenance of one more box.

There are companies which host SVN repositories.
Here are links to SVN (client and server) packages for various operating systems.
Disadvantages of SVN
I am using SVN on Windows machine for about 5 years and found that SVN has a few disadvantages :).
It is slow on large repositories
SVN (or its client -- TortoiseSVN) has one big disadvantage -- it terrible slow (while updating or committing) on large (thousands of files) repositories unless you have SSD drive.
Merging can be difficult
Many people complain about how hard merging is with SVN.
I do merging for about 4 years (including about 2 years in CVS -- that was terrible, but doable) and about 2 years with SVN.
And personally I don't find it hard -- on the other hand -- any merge is easy after merging branches in CVS :).
I do merge of large repository (two repositories in fact) once a week and rarely I have conflicts which are hard to solve (most of conflicts are solved automatically with diff software which I use).
However in case of project of a few developers merging should not be problem at all if you keep a few simple rules:

merge changes often,
avoid active development in various branches simultaneously.

Added in July 2011
Many devs recommended Distributed Version Control like Git or Mercurial.
From single developer perspective there are only a few important advantages of DVCS over SVN:

DVCS can be faster.
You can commit to local repository without access to central one.
DVCS is hot thing and fancy to use/learn (if someone pay for your learning).

And I don't think merging is a problem in case of single developer.
Joel Spolsky wrote tutorial about Mercurial which is definitively worth to read.
So, despite of many advantages of DVCS I would stay with SVN if merging or speed is not a problem.
Or try Mercurial, which according to this and this SO questions, is better supported (in July 2011) on Windows.
Added in July 2014
For about a year I use Git (Git Bash mainly) for my pet-projects (i.e. solving Euler problems) and local branches for each Euler problem are really nice feature -- exactly as it is described as advantage of DVCS. 
Today Git tooling on Windows is much, much better then 2 or more years ago.
You can use remote repo (like GitHub or ProjectLocker and many others) to keep 
copy of your project away from your workstation with no extra effort/money.
However I use GUI client only to looks at diffs (and sometimes to choose files to commit),
so it's better to not afraid of command line -- it's really nice.
So as of today I would go with Git.

I think that forms should be exclusively used as what they are basically, meaning graphic interface only, meaning here that they do not have to be debugged! The debugging job is then limited to your VBA modules and objects, which is a lot easier to handle. 
There is of course a natural tendency to add VBA code to forms and/or controls, specially when Access offers you these great ""after Update"" and ""on change"" events, but I definitely advise you not to put any form or control specific code in the form's module. This makes further maintenance and upgrade very costy, where your code is split between VBA modules and forms/controls modules.
This does not mean you cannot use anymore this AfterUpdate event! Just put standard code in the event, like this:
Private Sub myControl_AfterUpdate()  
    CTLAfterUpdate myControl
    On Error Resume Next
    Eval (""CTLAfterUpdate_MyForm()"")
    On Error GoTo 0  
End sub

Where:

CTLAfterUpdate is a standard procedure run each time a control is updated in a form
CTLAfterUpdateMyForm is a specific procedure run each time a control is updated on MyForm

I have then 2 modules. The first one is 

utilityFormEvents
 where I will have my CTLAfterUpdate generic event

The second one is 

MyAppFormEvents
 containing the specific code of all specific forms of the MyApp application
 and including the CTLAfterUpdateMyForm procedure. Of course, CTLAfterUpdateMyForm
 might not exist if there are no specific code to run. This is why we turn the 
 ""On error"" to ""resume next"" ...

Choosing such a generic solution means a lot. It means you are reaching a high level of code normalization (meaning painless maintenance of code). And when you say that you do not have any form-specific code,  it also means that form modules are fully standardized, and their production can be automated: just say which events you want to manage at the form/control level, and define your generic/specific procedures terminology.
Write your automation code, once for all.
It takes a few  days of work but it give exciting results. I have been using this solution for the last 2 years and it is clearly the right one: my forms are fully and automatically created from scratch with a ""Forms Table"", linked to a ""Controls Table"".
I can then spend my time working on the specific procedures of the form, if any.
Code normalization, even with MS Access, is a long process. But it is really worth the pain!

48070,"How do you handle Session State?  There is a built-in ""store the viewstate in the session state"" provider.  If you are storing the session state in some fast, out of proc system, that might be the best option for the viewstate.
edit: to do this add the following code to the your Page classes / global page base class
    protected override PageStatePersister PageStatePersister {
        get { return new SessionPageStatePersister(this); }
    }

Also... this is by no means a perfect (or even good) solution to a large viewstate.  As always, minimize the size of the viewstate as much as possible.  However, the SessionPageStatePersister is relatively intelligent and avoids storing an unbounded number of viewstates per session as well as avoids storing only a single viewstate per session.
"
48110,"You can generally twist a code coverage tool's arm and get a report that shows the paths that have been executed during a given run.  This report should show the code itself, with the first few columns marked up according to the coverage tool's particular notation on whether a given path was executed.
You might be able to use this straight up, or you might have to preprocess it and either remove the code that was not executed, or add a new notation on each line that tells whether it was executed (most tools will only show path information at control points):
So from a coverage tool you might get a report like this:
T- if(sometest)
   {
x     somecode;
   }
   else
   {
-     someother_code;
   }

The notation T- indicates that the if statement only ever evaluated to true, and so only the first part of the code executed.  The later notation 'x' indicates that this line was executed.
You should be able to form a regex that matches only when the first column contains a T, F, or x so you can capture all the control statements executed and lines executed.
Sometimes you'll only get coverage information at each control point, which then requires you to parse the C file and mark the execute lines yourself.  Not as easy, but not impossible either.
Still, this sounds like an interesting question where the solution is probably more work than it's worth...

48240,"If I get it right, you (should) have 2 models. A Route model, and a Stop model.

class Stop < ActiveRecorde::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :routes

create_table :routes do |t|
  t.integer :destination_id
  # Any other information you want to store about routes

end

create_table :routes_stops, :primary_key => [:route_id, :stop_id] do |t|

Route.find(numbers)

r = Route.find(number)
r.destination_id = destination
r.stops << stop

with the IList interface because the

49430,"The flow you are seeing is something like this:

Click on button
AnimationExtender catches action and call clickOn callback
linkPostback starts asynchronous request for page and then returns flow to AnimationExtender
Animation begins
pageRequest returns and calls playAnimation, which starts the animation again

I think there are at least two ways around this issue.  It seems you have almost all the javascript you need, you just need to work around AnimationExtender starting the animation on a click.
Option 1: Hide the AnimationExtender button and add a new button of your own that plays the animation.  This should be as simple as setting the AE button's style to ""display: none;"" and having your own button call linkPostback().
Option 2: Re-disable the Animation Extender once the animation has finished with.  This should work, as long as the playAnimation call is blocking, which it probably is:
function linkPostback() {

    var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();
    prm.add_endRequest(playAnimation)
}

function playAnimation() {

    AnimationExtender.Enabled = true;
    var onclkBehavior = $find(""ctl00_btnOpenList"").get_OnClickBehavior().get_animation();
    onclkBehavior.play();
    AnimationExtender.Enabled = false;
}

As an aside, it seems your general approach may face issues if there is a delay in receiving the pageRequest.  It may be a bit weird to click a button and several seconds later have the animation happen.  It may be better to either pre-load the data, or to pre-fill the div with some ""Loading..."" thing, make it about the right size, and then populate the actual contents when it arrives.
"
49450,"If you want to move the repository and keep history, you'll probably need filesystem access on both hosts.  The simplest solution, if your backend is FSFS (the default on recent versions), is to make a filesystem copy of the entire repository folder.
If you have a Berkley DB backend, if you're not sure of what your backend is, or if you're changing SVN version numbers, you're going to want to use svnadmin to dump your old repository and load it into your new repository.  Using svnadmin dump will give you a single file backup that you can copy to the new system.  Then you can create the new (empty) repository and use svnadmin load, which will essentially replay all the commits along with its metadata (author, timestamp, etc).
You can read more about the dump/load process here:
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate
Also, if you do svnadmin load, make sure you use the --force-uuid option, or otherwise people are going to have problems switching to the new repository.  Subversion uses a UUID to identify the repository internally, and it won't let you switch a working copy to a different repository.
If you don't have filesystem access, there may be other third party options out there (or you can write something) to help you migrate: essentially you'd have to use the svn log to replay each revision on the new repository, and then fix up the metadata afterwards.  You'll need the pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change hook scripts in place to do this, which sort of assumes filesystem access, so YMMV.  Or, if you don't want to keep the history, you can use your working copy to import into the new repository.  But hopefully this isn't the case.

"
49510,"There are four steps to making an app that can act as the default web browser. The first three steps allow your app to act as a role handler for the relevant URL schemes (HTTP and HTTPS) and the final step makes it the default role handler for those schemes.
1) Add the URL schemes your app can handle to your application's info.plist file
To add support for http:// and https:// you'd need to add the following to your application's info.plist file. This tells the OS that your application is capable of handling HTTP and HTTP URLs.
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>http URL</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>http</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>Secure http URL</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>https</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>

2) Write an URL handler method
This method will be called by the OS when it wants to use your application to open a URL. It doesn't matter which object you add this method to, that'll be explicitly passed to the Event Manager in the next step. The URL handler method should look something like this:
- (void)getUrl:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)event 
    withReplyEvent:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)replyEvent
{
  // Get the URL
  NSString *urlStr = [[event paramDescriptorForKeyword:keyDirectObject] 
    stringValue];

  //TODO: Your custom URL handling code here
}

3) Register the URL handler method
Next, tell the event manager which object and method to call when it wants to use your app to load an URL. In the code here I'm passed self as the event handler, assuming that we're calling setEventHandler from the same object that defines the getUrl:withReplyEvent: method.
You should add this code somewhere in your application's initialisation code.
NSAppleEventManager *em = [NSAppleEventManager sharedAppleEventManager];
[em 
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:kInternetEventClass 
  andEventID:kAEGetURL];

Some applications, including early versions of Adobe AIR, use the alternative WWW!/OURL AppleEvent to request that an application opens URLs, so to be compatible with those applications you should also add the following:
[em
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:'WWW!' 
  andEventID:'OURL'];

4) Set your app as the default browser
Everything we've done so far as told the OS that your application is a browser, now we need to make it the default browser.
We've got to use the Launch Services API to do this. In this case we're setting our app to be the default role handler for HTTP and HTTPS links:
CFStringRef bundleID = (CFStringRef)[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier];
OSStatus httpResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR(""http""), bundleID);
OSStatus httpsResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR(""https""), bundleID);
//TODO: Check httpResult and httpsResult for errors

(It's probably best to ask the user's permission before changing their default browser.)
Custom URL schemes
It's worth noting that you can also use these same steps to handle your own custom URL schemes. If you're creating a custom URL scheme it's a good idea to base it on your app's bundle identifier to avoid clashes with other apps. So if your bundle ID is com.example.MyApp you should consider using x-com-example-myapp:// URLs.

Because it has no child elements, you shouldn't get spurious mouseover and mouseout events propagating to it.

What I believe happens, is that when the cursor moves from a parent element onto a child element, a mouseout event occurs on the parent element, and a mouseover event occurs on the child element. However, if the mouseover handler on the child element does not catch the event and stop it propagating, the parent element will also receive the mouseover event.

49950,"If a class has a Dispose method the best practice is to call it. the reason
behind that is that Dispose runs when called, whereas setting the object to
null simply adds a entry to the Finalize queue in GC, and we cannot
determine when GC will run.
There is no performance benefit in implementing the Dispose method on types that use only managed resources (such as arrays) because they are automatically reclaimed by the garbage collector. Use the Dispose method primarily on managed objects that use native resources and on COM objects that are exposed to the .NET Framework. Managed objects that use native resources (such as the FileStream class) implement the IDisposable interface.
An elegant means of inoking Dispose that have adopted is using the ""using"" construct. For those of you who may not be familiar with the construct, it provide a means to implicity invoke Dispose() on an instance that implements IDisposable even if an exception is thrown durring the operation. The following is an example of the using construct: 
using(DisposableClass dc = new DisposableClass()) 
{ 
   dc.PerformActionOnUmanagedResources(); 
   dc.PerformAnotherActionOnUmanagedResources(); 
}

In the previous example, if an exception was thrown in the PerformActionOnUmanagedResources() method, although the PerformAnotherActionOnUmanagedResources() method would not be processed, the using block will still implicity invoke the Dispose method on dc ensuring the realese of any unmanaged resources.

51130,"I think nowadays developers are kind of ""dropping out of the demo scene"". In the good old days demos were all about ""what could you technically squeeze out of the machine"". You needed to be a good developer/coder/hacker to achieve the best. Today the development seems to be more like basic technical stuff. Most effects are already provided by the graphics adapter. It's not so much about the code, so as a coder ""you can't show off"". It's more about design, graphics, more design, music and even more design. That's in most cases not the developers' domain :)
However my guess would be that most good and experienced developers today have an history in demo scene, even if it's just a small one (just being interested and astonished).

"
51150,"I know this is very old now, but I just stumbled across it, and I know the answer.
In the applications you've seen (and written) where bringing the dialog box to the foreground did not bring the main window up along with it, the developer has simply neglected to specify the owner of the dialog box.
This applies to both modal windows, like dialog boxes and message boxes, as well as to modeless windows.  Setting the owner of a modeless popup also keeps the popup above its owner at all times.
In the Win32 API, the functions to bring up a dialog box or a message box take the owner window as a parameter:
INT_PTR DialogBox(
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    LPCTSTR lpTemplate,
    HWND hWndParent,      /* this is the owner */
    DLGPROC lpDialogFunc
);

int MessageBox(
    HWND hWnd,            /* this is the owner */
    LPCTSTR lpText,
    LPCTSTR lpCaption,
    UINT uType
);

Similary, in .NET WinForms, the owner can be specified:
public DialogResult ShowDialog(
    IWin32Window owner
)

public static DialogResult Show(
    IWin32Window owner,
    string text
) /* ...and other overloads that include this first parameter */

Additionally, in WinForms, it's easy to set the owner of a modeless window:
public void Show(
    IWin32Window owner,
)

or, equivalently:
form.Owner = this;
form.Show();

In straight WinAPI code, the owner of a modeless window can be set when the window is created:
HWND CreateWindow(
    LPCTSTR lpClassName,
    LPCTSTR lpWindowName,
    DWORD dwStyle,
    int x,
    int y,
    int nWidth,
    int nHeight,
    HWND hWndParent, /* this is the owner if dwStyle does not contain WS_CHILD */
    HMENU hMenu,
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    LPVOID lpParam
);

or afterwards:
SetWindowLong(hWndPopup, GWL_HWNDPARENT, (LONG)hWndOwner);

or (64-bit compatible)
SetWindowLongPtr(hWndPopup, GWLP_HWNDPARENT, (LONG_PTR)hWndOwner);

Note that MSDN has the following to say about SetWindowLong[Ptr]:

Do not call SetWindowLongPtr with the GWLP_HWNDPARENT index to change the parent of a child window. Instead, use the SetParent function. 

This is somewhat misleading, as it seems to imply that the last two snippets above are wrong.  This isn't so.  Calling SetParent will turn the intended popup into a child of the parent window (setting its WS_CHILD bit), rather than making it an owned window.  The code above is the correct way to make an existing popup an owned window.

Another option is simply that the file gets closed part-way through the read.

First, meta-modelling is not a set term, but rather a very fuzzy thing, including modelling models of models and reaching out to terms like MDA.

To get you at least started in the Eclipse department:

have a look at MOF, that is architecture for ""meta-modelling"" from the OMG (the guys, that maintain UML)
from there approach EMOF, a sub set which is supported by the Eclipse Modelling Framework in the incarnation of Ecore.
building something on top of GMF might be indeed a good idea, because that's the way existing diagram editors for the Eclipse platform take (e.g. Omondo's EclipseUML)
there are a lot of tools existing in the Eclipse environment, that can utilize Ecore - I simply hope, that GMF builts on top of Ecore itself.

51680,"OK, here's what I came up with for one of our applications. Note that it doesn't deal with the ""optional value"" scenario you mention, since our optional value is always 0, but it shouldn't be hard for you to modify.
Data is continually added to the series so we just keep the range of y values up to date by inspecting each data point as its added; this is very inexpensive and easy to keep track of. Equal minimum and maximum values are special cased: a spacing of 0 indicates that no markers should be drawn.

52290,"On general tips;
We are implementing a process of 
1) Business Requirements Statement (BRS)
2) Functional Specification
3) Technical specification
The BRS covers what the business problems are, and what the requirements are around solutions, testing, security, reliability and delivery. This defines what would make a successful solution.
The functional spec details what is needed, how it should look, how long fields should be, etc.
The technical spec details where the data comes from, any tricky code that may need to be considered.
The customer owns the requirements. The developers own the tech specs, and the functional spec is a middle ground. Testing is done against the tech specs (usually unit testing) then against the functional specs (usually system testing) and then against the requirements (UAT).
The important part of this (and we are struggling with) is that the developers still need to deliver to the functional spec, and the original business requirements. In reality the functional and tech specs are just there for clarity.
In short, my main tip is to first work out the process you wish to implement. Then seek agreement from all parties involved in your proposed process, then work on the templates to fit. The templates themselves are only are a small part of the change you want to make.

53480,"Kind of old, but It might be useful to future visitors. If you're already using the Levenshtein algorithm and you need to go a little better, I describe some very effective heuristics in this solution:
Getting the closest string match
The key is that you come up with 3 or 4 (or more) methods of gauging the similarity between your phrases (Levenshtein distance is just one method) - and then using real examples of strings you want to match as similar, you adjust the weightings and combinations of those heuristics until you get something that maximizes the number of positive matches. Then you use that formula for all future matches and you should see great results.
If a user is involved in the process, it's also best if you provide an interface which allows the user to see additional matches that rank highly in similarity in case they disagree with the first choice.
Here's an excerpt from the linked answer. If you end up wanting to use any of this code as is, I apologize in advance for having to convert VBA into C#.

Simple, speedy, and a very useful metric. Using this, I created two separate metrics for evaluating the similarity of two strings. One I call ""valuePhrase"" and one I call ""valueWords"". valuePhrase is just the Levenshtein distance between the two phrases, and valueWords splits the string into individual words, based on delimiters such as spaces, dashes, and anything else you'd like, and compares each word to each other word, summing up the shortest Levenshtein distance connecting any two words. Essentially, it measures whether the information in one 'phrase' is really contained in another, just as a word-wise permutation. I spent a few days as a side project coming up with the most efficient way possible of splitting a string based on delimiters.
valueWords, valuePhrase, and Split function:
Public Function valuePhrase#(ByRef S1$, ByRef S2$)
    valuePhrase = LevenshteinDistance(S1, S2)
End Function

Public Function valueWords#(ByRef S1$, ByRef S2$)
    Dim wordsS1$(), wordsS2$()
    wordsS1 = SplitMultiDelims(S1, "" _-"")

    Dim wordsTotal#
    For word1 = LBound(wordsS1) To UBound(wordsS1)
        wordbest = Len(S2)
        For word2 = LBound(wordsS2) To UBound(wordsS2)
            thisD = LevenshteinDistance(wordsS1(word1), wordsS2(word2))
            If thisD < wordbest Then wordbest = thisD
            If thisD = 0 Then GoTo foundbest

Measures of Similarity
Using these two metrics, and a third which simply computes the distance between two strings, I have a series of variables which I can run an optimization algorithm to achieve the greatest number of matches. Fuzzy string matching is, itself, a fuzzy science, and so by creating linearly independent metrics for measuring string similarity, and having a known set of strings we wish to match to each other, we can find the parameters that, for our specific styles of strings, give the best fuzzy match results.
Initially, the goal of the metric was to have a low search value for for an exact match, and increasing search values for increasingly permuted measures. In an impractical case, this was fairly easy to define using a set of well defined permutations, and engineering the final formula such that they had increasing search values results as desired.

As you can see, the last two metrics, which are fuzzy string matching metrics, already have a natural tendency to give low scores to strings that are meant to match (down the diagonal). This is very good. 
Application
To allow the optimization of fuzzy matching, I weight each metric. As such, every application of fuzzy string match can weight the parameters differently. The formula that defines the final score is a simply combination of the metrics and their weights:
value = Min(phraseWeight*phraseValue, wordsWeight*wordsValue)*minWeight + 
        Max(phraseWeight*phraseValue, wordsWeight*wordsValue)*maxWeight + lengthWeight*lengthValue

Using an optimization algorithm (neural network is best here because it is a discrete, multi-dimentional problem), the goal is now to maximize the number of matches. I created a function that detects the number of correct matches of each set to each other, as can be seen in this final screenshot. A column or row gets a point if the lowest score is assigned the the string that was meant to be matched, and partial points are given if there is a tie for the lowest score, and the correct match is among the tied matched strings. I then optimized it. You can see that a green cell is the column that best matches the current row, and a blue square around the cell is the row that best matches the current column. The score in the bottom corner is roughly the number of successful matches and this is what we tell our optimization problem to maximize.

One option to fix this is rather than setting it to be ""full screen"" just make the window the same size as the screen with location (0,0).  You can get screen information from the GraphicsConfigurations on the GraphicsDevice.

54230,"CakePHP's built-in ACL system is really powerful, but poorly documented in terms of actual implementation details. A system that we've used with some success in a number of CakePHP-based projects is as follows.
It's a modification of some group-level access systems that have been documented elsewhere. Our system's aims are to have a simple system where users are authorised on a group-level, but they can have specific additional rights on items that were created by them, or on a per-user basis. We wanted to avoid having to create a specific entry for each user (or, more specifically for each ARO) in the aros_acos table.
We have a Users table, and a Roles table.
Users
user_id, user_name, role_id
Roles
id, role_name
Create the ARO tree for each role (we usually have 4 roles - Unauthorised Guest (id 1), Authorised User (id 2), Site Moderator (id 3) and Administrator (id 4)) :
cake acl create aro / Role.1
cake acl create aro 1 Role.2  ... etc ...
After this, you have to use SQL or phpMyAdmin or similar to add aliases for all of these, as the cake command line tool doesn't do it. We use 'Role-{id}' and 'User-{id}' for all of ours.
We then create a ROOT ACO - 
cake acl create aco / 'ROOT'
and then create ACOs for all the controllers under this ROOT one:
cake acl create aco 'ROOT' 'MyController' ... etc ...
So far so normal. We add an additional field in the aros_acos table called _editown  which we can use as an additional action in the ACL component's actionMap.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `aros_acos` (
`id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
`aro_id` int(11) default NULL,
`aco_id` int(11) default NULL,
`_create` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_read` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_update` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_delete` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_editown` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
KEY `acl` (`aro_id`,`aco_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

We can then setup the Auth component to use the 'crud' method, which validates the requested controller/action against an AclComponent::check(). In the app_controller we have something along the lines of:
private function setupAuth() {
    if(isset($this->Auth)) {
        ....
        $this->Auth->authorize = 'crud';
        $this->Auth->actionMap = array( 'index'     => 'read',
                        'add'       => 'create',
                        'edit'      => 'update'
                        'editMine'  => 'editown',
                        'view'      => 'read'
                        ... etc ...
                        );
        ... etc ...
    }
}

Again, this is fairly standard CakePHP stuff. We then have a checkAccess method in the AppController that adds in the group-level stuff to check whether to check a group ARO or a user ARO for access:
private function checkAccess() {
    if(!$user = $this->Auth->user()) {
        $role_alias = 'Role-1';
        $user_alias = null;
    } else {
        $role_alias = 'Role-' . $user['User']['role_id'];
        $user_alias = 'User-' . $user['User']['id'];
    }

    // do we have an aro for this user?
    if($user_alias && ($user_aro = $this->User->Aro->findByAlias($user_alias))) {
        $aro_alias = $user_alias;
    } else {
        $aro_alias = $role_alias;
    }

    if ('editown' == $this->Auth->actionMap[$this->action]) {
        if($this->Acl->check($aro_alias, $this->name, 'editown') and $this->isMine()) {
            $this->Auth->allow();
        } else {
            $this->Auth->authorize = 'controller';
            $this->Auth->deny('*');
        }
    } else {
        // check this user-level aro for access
        if($this->Acl->check($aro_alias, $this->name, $this->Auth->actionMap[$this->action])) {
            $this->Auth->allow();
        } else {
            $this->Auth->authorize = 'controller';
            $this->Auth->deny('*');
        }
    }
}

The setupAuth() and checkAccess() methods are called in the AppController's beforeFilter() callback. There's an isMine method in the AppControler too (see below) that just checks that the user_id of the requested item is the same as the currently authenticated user. I've left this out for clarity.
That's really all there is to it. You can then allow / deny particular groups access to specific acos - 
cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'read'
cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'editown'
cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'update'
cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'delete'
I'm sure you get the picture.
Anyway, this answer's way longer than I intended it to be, and it probably makes next to no sense, but I hope it's some help to you ...
-- edit --
As requested, here's an edited (purely for clarity - there's a lot of stuff in our boilerplate code that's meaningless here) isMine() method that we have in our AppController. I've removed a lot of error checking stuff too, but this is the essence of it:
function isMine($model=null, $id=null, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {
    if(empty($model)) {
        // default model is first item in $this->uses array
        $model = $this->uses[0];
    }

    if(empty($id)) {
        if(!empty($this->passedArgs['id'])) {
        $id = $this->passedArgs['id'];
        } elseif(!empty($this->passedArgs[0])) {
            $id = $this->passedArgs[0];
        }
    }

    if(is_array($id)) {
        foreach($id as $i) {
            if(!$this->_isMine($model, $i, $usermodel, $foreignkey)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    return $this->_isMine($model, $id, $usermodel, $foreignkey);
}


function _isMine($model, $id, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {
    $user = Configure::read('curr.loggedinuser'); // this is set in the UsersController on successful login

    if(isset($this->$model)) {
        $model = $this->$model;
    } else {
        $model = ClassRegistry::init($model);
    }

    //read model
    if(!($record = $model->read(null, $id))) {
        return false;
    }

    //get foreign key
    if($usermodel == $model->alias) {
        if($record[$model->alias][$model->primaryKey] == $user['User']['id']) {
            return true;
        }
    } elseif($record[$model->alias][$foreignkey] == $user['User']['id']) {
        return true;

bytea being a ""normal"" column also means the value being read completely into memory when you fetch it. Blobs, in contrast, you can stream into stdout. That helps in reducing the server memory footprint. Especially, when you store 4-6 MPix images.
No problem with backing up blobs. pg_dump provides ""-b"" option to include the large objects into the backup.
So, I prefer using pg_lo_*, you may guess.
Re Kris Erickson's answer:
I'd say the opposite :). When images are not the only data you store, don't store them on the file system unless you absolutely have to. It's such a benefit to be always sure about your data consistency, and to have the data ""in one piece"" (the DB). BTW, PostgreSQL is great in preserving consistency.
However, true, reality is often too performance-demanding ;-), and it pushes you to serve the binary files from the file system. But even then I tend to use the DB as the ""master"" storage for binaries, with all the other relations consistently linked, while providing some file system-based caching mechanism for performance optimization.

54790,"Current status (Mono 2.10, 2011): xbuild is now able to build all versions of Visual Studio / MSBuild projects, including .sln files. Simply run xbuild just as you would execute msbuild on Microsoft .Net Framework. You don't need Monodevelop installed, xbuild comes with the standard Mono installation.
If your build uses custom tasks, they should still work if they don't depend on Windows executables (such as rmdir or xcopy).
When you are editing project files, use standard Windows path syntax - they will be converted by xbuild, if necessary. One important caveat to this rule is case sensitivity - don't mix different casings of the same file name. If you have a project that does this, you can enable compatibility mode by invoking MONO_IOMAP=case xbuild foo.sln (or try MONO_IOMAP=all). Mono has a page describing more advanced MSBuild project porting techniques.
Mono 2.0 answer (2008): xbuild is not yet complete (it works quite well with VS2005 .csproj files, has problems with VS2008 .csproj and does not handle .sln). Mono 2.1 plans to merge the code base of mdtool (MonoDevelop command line build engine) into it, but currently mdtool is a better choice. mdtool build -f:project.sln or man mdtool if you have MonoDevelop installed.

54980,"From what I understand, prepared statements will reuse the generated SQL plan if it is the same statement, so the database will see the same prepared statement and not have to do the work to figure out how to query the database. I would say the extra work of saving the prepared statement in Product::getPrice_A is not typically very helpful, more because it can obscure the code rather than an issue of performance.  When dealing with performance, I feel it's always best to focus on code clarity and then performance when you have real statistics that indicate a problem.
I would say ""yes, the extra work is unnecessary"" (regardless of if it really boosts performance).  Also, I am not a very big DB expert, but the performance gain of prepared statements is something I heard from others, and it is at the database level, not the code level (so if the code is actually invoking a parameterized statement on the actual DB, then the DB can do these execution plan caching... though depending on the database, you may get the benefit even without the parameterized statement).
Anyways, if you are really worried about (and seeing) database performance issues, you should look into a caching solution... of which I would highly recommend memcached.  With such a solution, you can cache your query results and not even hit the database for things you access frequently.

When you run the program, the words are loaded into a trie in memory.  After that, just type in the letters you want to search with and it will print the results.  It will only show results that use all of the input letters, nothing shorter.
It filters short words from the output, otherwise the number of results is huge.  Feel free to tweak the MIN_WORD_SIZE setting.  Keep in mind, just using ""astronomers"" as input gives 233,549 results if MIN_WORD_SIZE is 1.  Perhaps you can find a shorter word list that only contains more common English words.
Also, the contraction ""I'm"" (from one of your examples) won't show up in the results unless you add ""im"" to the dictionary and set MIN_WORD_SIZE to 2.
The trick to getting multiple words is to jump back to the root node in the trie whenever you encounter a complete word in the search.  Then you keep traversing the trie until all letters have been used.

Finally, you will only be able to access a single 64KB code segment of 68000 machine code.  Inter-segment jumps don't work properly without globals set up.
You can get around a lot of these restrictions by moving the majority of your code to a PNOlet, but that's an entirely different and more complicated topic.
If you want to do something more complicated that could take a while (e.g. load a web page or download email), it is strongly recommended not to do it during the alarm launch code.  You could do something in the sysAppLaunchCmdDisplayAlarm launch code and display a form to the user allowing them to cancel.  But this is bound to get annoying quickly.
Better for the user experience (but much more complicated) is to become a background application.  This is a bit of black magic and is not really well supported, but it is possible.  There are basically three steps to becoming a background application:

Protect your application database using DmDatabaseProtect.  This will ensure that your application is locked down so it can't be deleted.
Lock your code segment using MemHandleLock and MemHandleSetOwner (set the owner to 0).  This will ensure that your code is loaded into memory and won't be moved.
Register for some notifications.  For example, the sysNotifyIdleTimeEvent is a great notification to use to do some periodic background processing.

Once you set this up, you can exit from the alarm launch code and then wait for your notifications to fire.  You will then do all of your background processing when your notification handlers are called.
Also make sure that if you allocate any system objects (memory, handles, file handles, etc.), you set their owner to 0 (system) if you expect them to persist after you return from your notification handler.  Otherwise the system will clean them up.  If you do this, be super careful to avoid memory and resource leaks!!  They will never get cleaned up when the owner is set to 0!
To leave background mode, simply do the reverse: unregister for notifications, unlock your code segment, and unprotect your application database.
If you do any network operations in the background, be sure that you set the sockets to non-blocking mode and deal correctly with that!  Otherwise you will block the foreground application and cause problems.

I am guessing, from your description, that this is a primary table in the database, referenced by many other tables in FK relationships.

In mathematics, a Square is a Rectangle. Indeed it is a specialization of a rectangle. The ""is a"" makes you want to model this with inheritance. However if in code you made Square derive from Rectangle, then a Square should be usable anywhere you expect a Rectangle. This makes for some strange behavior. 
Imagine you had SetWidth and SetHeight methods on your Rectangle base class; this seems perfectly logical. However if your Rectangle reference pointed to a Square, then SetWidth and SetHeight doesn't make sense because setting one would change the other to match it. In this case Square fails the Liskov Substitution Test with Rectangle and the abstraction of having Square inherit from Rectangle is a bad one.

Finally the VSSLabel task will label all your files appropriately.

58280,"Ok, IÃ¢ÂÂve done  a little more research into this now.
When you create a windows service in .Net, you create a class that inherits from System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase (In VB this is hidden in the .Designer.vb file). You then override the OnStart and OnStop function, and OnPause and OnContinue if you choose to. 
These methods are invoked from within the base class so I did a little poking around with reflector.
OnStart is invoked by a method in System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase called ServiceQueuedMainCallback.  The vesion on my machine ""System.ServiceProcess, Version=2.0.0.0"" decompiles like this:


Private Sub ServiceQueuedMainCallback(ByVal state As Object)
    Dim args As String() = DirectCast(state, String())
    Try 
        Me.OnStart(args)
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartSuccessful""))
        Me.status.checkPoint = 0
        Me.status.waitHint = 0
        Me.status.currentState = 4
    Catch exception As Exception
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartFailed"", New Object() { exception.ToString }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    Catch obj1 As Object
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartFailed"", New Object() { String.Empty }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    End Try
    Me.startCompletedSignal.Set
End Sub


So because Me.OnStart(args) is called from within the Try portion of a Try Catch block I assume that anything that happens within the OnStart method is effectively wrapped by that Try Catch block and therefore any exceptions that occur aren't technically unhandled as they are actually handled in the ServiceQueuedMainCallback Try Catch. So CurrentDomain.UnhandledException never actually happens at least during the startup routine. 
The other 3 entry points (OnStop, OnPause and OnContinue) are all called from the base class in a similar way.
So I Ã¢ÂÂthinkÃ¢ÂÂ that explains why my Exception Handling component canÃ¢ÂÂt catch UnhandledException on Start and Stop, but IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure if it explains why timers that are setup in OnStart canÃ¢ÂÂt cause an UnhandledException when they fire.

Just create a .CMD file that contains the call to rsync with all the correct parameters and let people call that. rsync is very smart in deciding what part of files need to be transferred, so it'll be very fast even when large files are involved.
What rsync doesn't do though is conflict resolution (or even detection), but in the scenario you described it's more like reading from a central place which is what rsync is designed to handle.

Double click on the package variable name. (This allows you to access the properties of the variable)
Set the property 'EvaluateAsExpression' to true

Set the OLE DB source query to SQL Command from Variable

The expression builder can dynamically create expressions using variable to create 'parametised queries'.
So the following 'normal' query:

Can be written in the expression builder as:
""select * from book where book.BOOK_ID = "" + @[User::BookID]

You can then do null handling and data conversion using the expression builder.

You may be running into concurrency issues, depending on how your application runs. Try performing your reads with the ""nolock"" keyword. 
Try adding in table aliases for your columns (and avoid the use of SELECT *), this helps out MSSQL, as it doesn't have to ""guess"" which table the columns come from. 
If you aren't already, move to SPROCs, this allows MSSQL to index your data better for a given query's normal result set.
Try following the execution plan of your SPROCS to ensure they are using the indexes you think they are.
Run a trace against your database to see what the incoming requests look like. You may notice a particular SPROC is being run over and over: generally a good sign to cache the responses on the client if possible. (lookup lists, etc.)

59130,"A couple of things that I've learned:

Absolutely and brutally minimize the number of images you have that contain text. Doing so will make your life a billion percent easier since you won't have to get a new set of images for every friggin' language.
Be very wary of css positioning that relies on things always remaining the same size. If  those things contain text, they will not remain the same size, and you will then need to go back and fix your designs.
If you use character types in your sql tables, make sure that any of those that might receive international input are unicode (nchar, nvarchar, ntext). For that matter, I would just standardize on using the unicode versions.
If you're building SQL queries dynamically, make sure that you include the N prefix before any quoted text if there's any chance that text might be unicode. If you end up putting garbage in a SQL table, check to see if that's there.
Make sure that all your web pages definitively state that they are in a unicode format. See Joel's article, mentioned above.
You're going to be using resource files a lot for this project. That's good - ASP.NET 2.0 has great support for such. You'll want to look into the App_LocalResources and App_GlobalResources folder as well as GetLocalResourceObject, GetGlobalResourceObject, and the concept of meta:resourceKey. Chapter 30 of Professional ASP.NET 2.0 has some great content regarding that. The 3.5 version of the book may well have good content there as well, but I don't own it.
Think about fonts. Many of the standard fonts you might want to use aren't unicode capable. I've always had luck with Arial Unicode MS, MS Gothic, MS Mincho. I'm not sure about how cross-platform these are, though. Also, note that not all fonts support all of the Unicode character definition. Again, test, test, test.
Start thinking now about how you're going to get translations into this system. Go talk to whoever is your translation vendor about how they want data passed back and forth for translation. Think about the fact that, through your local resource files, you will likely be repeating some commonly used strings through the system. Do you normalize those into global resource files, or do you have some sort of database layer where only one copy of each text used is generated. In our recent project, we used resource files which were generated from a database table that contained all the translations and the original, english version of the resource files. 
Test. Generally speaking I will test in German, Polish, and an Asian language (Japanese, Chinese, Korean). German and Polish are wordy and nearly guaranteed to stretch text areas, Asian languages use an entirely different set of characters which tests your unicode support.

I believe that CAPTCHA is dying. If someone really wants to break it, it will be broken. I read (somewhere, don't remember where) about a site that gave you free porn in exchange for answering CAPTCHAs to they can be rendered obsolete by bots. So, why bother?

Anyone who really wants to break this padlock can use a pair of bolt cutters, so why bother with the lock?
Anyone who really wants to steal this car can drive up with a tow truck, so why bother locking my car?
Anyone who really wants to open this safe can cut it open with an oxyacetylene torch, so why bother putting things in the safe?
Because using the padlock, locking your car, putting valuables in a safe, and using a CAPTCHA weeds out a large spectrum of relatively unsophisticated or unmotivated attackers.  The fact that it doesn't stop sophisticated, highly motivated attackers doesn't mean that it doesn't work at all.  Using a CAPTCHA isn't going to stop all spammers, but it's going to tremendously reduce the amount that requires filtering or manual intervention.  
Heck look at the lame CAPTCHA that Jeff uses on his blog.  Even a wimpy barrier like that still provides a lot of protection.

When should the lock be used?

A lock should be used to protect shared resources in multithreaded code.  Not for anything else.

But is it necessary when the application does not spin off any other threads?

Absolutely not.  It's just a time waster.  However do be sure that you're not implicitly using system threads.  For example if you use asynchronous I/O you may receive callbacks from a random thread, not your original thread.

Is there performance issues with using lock?

Yes.  They're not very big in a single-threaded application, but why make calls you don't need?

...if that is a good design pattern to follow in the future[?]

Locking everything willy-nilly is a terrible design pattern.  If your code is cluttered with random locking and then you do decide to use a background thread for some work, you're likely to run into deadlocks.  Sharing a resource between multiple threads requires careful design, and the more you can isolate the tricky part, the better.

declare @XmlDocumentHandle int
declare @XmlDocument nvarchar(1000)
set @XmlDocument = N'<ROOT>
<Customer>
   <FirstName>Will</FirstName>
   <LastName>Smith</LastName>
</Customer>
</ROOT>'

-- Create temp table to insert data into
create table #Customer 
( 
    FirstName varchar(20),
    LastName varchar(20) 
)
-- Create an internal representation of the XML document.
exec sp_xml_preparedocument @XmlDocumentHandle output, @XmlDocument

-- Insert using openxml allows us to read the structure
insert into #Customer
select 
    FirstName = XmlFirstName,
    LastName = XmlLastName
from openxml ( @XmlDocumentHandle, '/ROOT/Customer',2 )
with 
(
    XmlFirstName  varchar(20) 'FirstName',
    XmlLastName varchar(20) 'LastName'

where ( XmlFirstName = 'Will' and XmlLastName = 'Smith' )

-- Cleanup xml document
exec sp_xml_removedocument @XmlDocumentHandle

-- Show the data
select * 
from #Customer

-- Drop tmp table
drop table #Customer

If you have an xml file and are using C#, then defining a stored procedure that does something like the above and then passing the entire xml file contents to the stored procedure as a string should give you a fairly straight forward way of importing xml into your existing table(s).

NOTE that this is a general look at stored procedures not regulated to a specific
  DBMS. Some DBMS (and even, different
  versions of the same DBMS!) may operate
  contrary to this, so you'll want to
  double-check with your target DBMS
  before assuming all of this still holds.
I've been a Sybase ASE, MySQL, and SQL Server DBA on-and off since for almost a decade (along with application development in C, PHP, PL/SQL, C#.NET, and Ruby). So, I have no particular axe to grind in this (sometimes) holy war.

The historical performance benefit of stored procs have generally been from the following (in no particular order):

Pre-parsed SQL
Pre-generated query execution plan
Reduced network latency
Potential cache benefits

Pre-parsed SQL -- similar benefits to compiled vs. interpreted code, except on a very micro level. 
Still an advantage? 
Not very noticeable at all on the modern CPU, but if you are sending a single SQL statement that is VERY large eleventy-billion times a second, the parsing overhead can add up.
Pre-generated query execution plan. 
If you have many JOINs the permutations can grow quite unmanageable (modern optimizers have limits and cut-offs for performance reasons). It is not unknown for very complicated SQL to have distinct, measurable (I've seen a complicated query take 10+ seconds just to generate a plan, before we tweaked the DBMS) latencies due to the optimizer trying to figure out the ""near best"" execution plan. Stored procedures will, generally, store this in memory so you can avoid this overhead.
Still an advantage? 
Most DBMS' (the latest editions) will cache the query plans for INDIVIDUAL SQL statements, greatly reducing the performance differential between stored procs and ad hoc SQL. There are some caveats and cases in which this isn't the case, so you'll need to test on your target DBMS.
Also, more and more DBMS allow you to provide optimizer path plans (abstract query plans) to significantly reduce optimization time (for both ad hoc and stored procedure SQL!!).

WARNING Cached query plans are not a performance panacea. Occasionally the query plan that is generated is sub-optimal.
  For example, if you send SELECT *
  FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND
  99999999, the DBMS may select a
  full-table scan instead of an index
  scan because you're grabbing every row
  in the table (so sayeth the
  statistics). If this is the cached
  version, then you can get poor
  performance when you later send
  SELECT * FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN
  1 AND 2. The reasoning behind this is
  outside the scope of this posting, but
  for further reading see:
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/frcqupln.mspx
  and
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181055.aspx
  and http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/performance/execution-plan-basics/
""In summary, they determined that
  supplying anything other than the
  common values when a compile or
  recompile was performed resulted in
  the optimizer compiling and caching
  the query plan for that particular
  value. Yet, when that query plan was
  reused for subsequent executions of
  the same query for the common values
  (Ã¢ÂÂMÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂRÃ¢ÂÂ, or Ã¢ÂÂTÃ¢ÂÂ), it resulted in
  sub-optimal performance. This
  sub-optimal performance problem
  existed until the query was
  recompiled. At that point, based on
  the @P1 parameter value supplied, the
  query might or might not have a
  performance problem.""

Reduced network latency
A) If you are running the same SQL over and over -- and the SQL adds up to many KB of code -- replacing that with a simple ""exec foobar"" can really add up.
B) Stored procs can be used to move procedural code into the DBMS. This saves shuffling large amounts of data off to the client only to have it send a trickle of info back (or none at all!). Analogous to doing a JOIN in the DBMS vs. in your code (everyone's favorite WTF!)
Still an advantage?
A) Modern 1Gb (and 10Gb and up!) Ethernet really make this negligible. 
B) Depends on how saturated your network is -- why shove several megabytes of data back and forth for no good reason?
Potential cache benefits
Performing server-side transforms of data can potentially be faster if you have sufficient memory on the DBMS and the data you need is in memory of the server.
Still an advantage?
Unless your app has shared memory access to DBMS data, the edge will always be to stored procs.
Of course, no discussion of Stored Procedure optimization would be complete without a discussion of parameterized and ad hoc SQL.
Parameterized / Prepared SQL
Kind of a cross between stored procedures and ad hoc SQL, they are embedded SQL statements in a host language that uses ""parameters"" for query values, e.g.:
SELECT .. FROM yourtable WHERE foo = ? AND bar = ?

These provide a more generalized version of a query that modern-day optimizers can use to cache (and re-use) the query execution plan, resulting in much of the performance benefit of stored procedures.
Ad Hoc SQL
Just open a console window to your DBMS and type in a SQL statement. In the past, these were the ""worst"" performers (on average) since the DBMS had no way of pre-optimizing the queries as in the parameterized/stored proc method.
Still a disadvantage?
Not necessarily. Most DBMS have the ability to ""abstract"" ad hoc SQL into parameterized versions -- thus more or less negating the difference between the two. Some do this implicitly or must be enabled with a command setting (SQL server: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx , Oracle: http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm).
Lessons learned?
Moore's law continues to march on and DBMS optimizers, with every release, get more sophisticated. Sure, you can place every single silly teeny SQL statement inside a stored proc, but just know that the programmers working on optimizers are very smart and are continually looking for ways to improve performance. Eventually (if it's not here already) ad hoc SQL performance will become indistinguishable (on average!) from stored procedure performance, so any sort of massive stored procedure use ** solely for ""performance reasons""** sure sounds like premature optimization to me.
Anyway, I think if you avoid the edge cases and have fairly vanilla SQL, you won't notice a difference between ad hoc and stored procedures.

60000,"C++03 std, ÃÂ§4.11 2 Pointer to member conversions:

An rvalue of type Ã¢ÂÂpointer to member of B of type cv T,Ã¢ÂÂ where B is a class type, can be converted to an rvalue of type Ã¢ÂÂpointer to member of D of type cv T,Ã¢ÂÂ where D is a derived class (clause 10) of B. If B is an inaccessible (clause 11), ambiguous (10.2) or virtual (10.1) base class of D, a program that necessitates this conversion is ill-formed. The result of the conversion refers to the same member as the pointer to member before the conversion took place, but it refers to the base class member as if it were a member of the derived class. The result refers to the member in DÃ¢ÂÂs instance of B. Since the result has type Ã¢ÂÂpointer to member of D of type cv T,Ã¢ÂÂ it can be dereferenced with a D object. The result is the same as if the pointer to member of B were dereferenced with the B sub-object of D.   The null member pointer value is converted to the null member pointer value of the destination type. 52)
52)The rule for conversion of pointers to members (from pointer to member of base to pointer to member of derived) appears inverted compared to the rule for pointers to objects (from pointer to derived to pointer to base) (4.10, clause 10). This inversion is necessary to ensure type safety. Note that a pointer to member is not a pointer to object or a pointer to function and the rules for conversions of such pointers do not apply to pointers to members. In particular, a pointer to member cannot be converted to a void*.

In short, you can convert a pointer to a member of an accessible, non-virtual base class to a pointer to a member of a derived class as long as the member isn't ambiguous.

   mbr = &F::bam; // invalid: conversion isn't defined by the standard
   ...

Conversion in the other direction (via static_cast) is governed by ÃÂ§ 5.2.9 9:

An rvalue of type ""pointer to member of D of type cv1 T"" can be converted to an rvalue of type ""pointer to member of B of type cv2 T"", where B is a base class (clause 10 class.derived) of D, if a valid standard conversion from ""pointer to member of B of type T"" to ""pointer to member of D of type T"" exists (4.11 conv.mem), and cv2 is the same cv-qualification as, or greater cv-qualification than, cv1.11) The null member pointer value (4.11 conv.mem) is converted to the null member pointer value of the destination type. If class B contains the original member, or is a base or derived class of the class containing the original member, the resulting pointer to member points to the original member.  Otherwise, the result of the cast is undefined. [Note: although class B need not contain the original member, the dynamic type of the object on which the pointer to member is dereferenced must contain the original member; see 5.5 expr.mptr.oper.]
11) Function types (including those used in pointer to member function
    types) are never cv-qualified; see 8.3.5 dcl.fct.

In short, you can convert from a derived D::* to a base B::* if you can convert from a B::* to a D::*, though you can only use the B::* on objects that are of type D or are descended from D.

60100,"I like to start refactoring when I need to, rather than the first opportunity that I get. You might say this is somewhat of an agile approach to refactoring. When do I feel I need to? Usually when I feel that the ugly parts of my codes are starting to spread. I think ugliness is okay as long as they are contained, but the moment when they start having the urge to spread, that's when you need to take care of business. 
The techniques you use for refactoring should start with the simplest. I would strongly recommand Martin Fowler's book. Combining common code into functions, removing unneeded variables, and other simple techniques gets you a lot of mileage. For list operations, I prefer using functional programming idioms. That is to say, I use internal iterators, map, filter and reduce(in python speak, there are corresponding things in ruby, lisp and haskell) whenever I can, this makes code a lot shorter and more self-contained.

A tag cloud or word cloud (or weighted list in visual design) is a visual depiction of user-generated tags, or simply the word content of a site, used typically to describe the content of web sites. Tags are usually single words and are typically listed alphabetically, and the importance of a tag is shown with font size or color.

Anyway, if the classes are outside of a jar you can simply use the applet classloader and load them by name. Ex:
ClassLoader loader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
Class clazz = loader.loadClass(""acme.AppletAddon"");

If you want to load classes from a jar I think you will need to create a new instance of URLClassLoader with the url(s) of the jar(s).
URL[] urls = new URL[]{new URL(""http://localhost:8080/addon.jar"")};
URLClassLoader loader = URLClassLoader.newInstance(urls,this.getClass().getClassLoader());

By default, applets are forbidden to create new classloaders. But if you sign your applet and include permission to create new classloaders you can do it.

60570,"I think most people refer to this as the Handle Body idiom. See James Coplien's book Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms (Amazon link). It's also known as the Cheshire Cat because of Lewis Caroll's character that fades away until only the grin remains.
The example code should be distributed across two sets of source files. Then only Cat.h is the file that is shipped with the product.
CatImpl.h is included by Cat.cpp and CatImpl.cpp contains the implementation for CatImpl::Purr(). This won't be visible to the public using your product.
Basically the idea is to hide as much as possible of the implementation fom prying eyes.
This is most useful where you have a commercial product that is shipped as a series of libraries that are accessed via an API that the customer's code is compiled against and linked to.
We did this with the rewrite of IONAs Orbix 3.3 product in 2000.
As mentioned by others, using his technique completely decouples the implementation from the interface of the object. Then you won't have to recompile everything that uses Cat if you just want to change the implementation of Purr().
This technique is used in a methodology called design by contract.

60830,"It worth pointing out that the inline keyword is actually just a hint to the compiler. The compiler may ignore the inline and simply generate code for the function someplace.
The main drawback to inline functions is that it can increase the size of your executable (depending on the number of instantiations).  This can be a problem on some platforms (eg. embedded systems), especially if the function itself is recursive.
I'd also recommend making inline'd functions very small - The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost.

A brief excerpt from the long list of options:

Latest versions of ConEmu may set up itself as default terminal for Windows
Use any font installed in the system, or copied to a folder of the program (ttf, otf, fon, bdf)
Run selected tabs as Administrator (Vista+) or as selected user
Windows 7 Jump lists and Progress on taskbar
Integration with DosBox (useful in 64bit systems to run DOS applications)
Smooth resize, maximized and fullscreen window modes
Scrollbar initially hidden, may be revealed by mouseover or checkbox in settings
Optional settings (e.g. pallette) for selected applications
User friendly text and block selection (from keyboard or mouse), copy, paste, text search in console
ANSI X3.64 and Xterm 256 color

Far Manager users will acquire shell style drag-n-drop, thumbnails and tiles in panles, tabs for editors and viewers, true colors and font styles (italic/bold/underline).

61320,"Both are very similar but Subversive is the ""eclipse svn provider"". I primarily use Subversive because of a few convenient features:
Grouping of history
When I'm browsing the history of a branch instead of just seeing a bunch of rows for every commit it can group commits by today, week, etc.
Mapping of trunk, branches, and tags
Subversive assumes the default svn layout: trunk, branches, tags (which you can change), so whenever you want to tag or branch it is one click and you provide the name of the tag or branch.
Like I said these are minor differences that I just find convenient. Both work great with mylyn, but overall there really isn't a whole lot of differences with these two extensions.
Merging with Subversive is a pain though (haven't tried Subclipse), I've never been able to successfully merge. The preview of the merge is great but it would never complete the merge or it will take way to long. Most of the time I complete merging through the command line without any issues.
"
61400,"Let me begin by plugging sources - Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit (There's a version with C#-Nunit too.. but I have this one.. its agnostic for the most part. Recommended.)
Good Tests should be A TRIP (The acronymn isn't sticky enough - I have a printout of the cheatsheet in the book that I had to pull out to make sure I got this right..)

Automatic : Invoking of tests as well as checking results for PASS/FAIL should be automatic
Thorough: Coverage; Although bugs tend to cluster around certain regions in the code, ensure that you test all key paths and scenarios.. Use tools if you must to know untested regions
Repeatable: Tests should produce the same results each time.. every time. Tests should not rely on uncontrollable params.
Independent: Very important. 

Tests should test only one thing at a time. Multiple assertions are okay as long as they are all testing one feature/behavior. When a test fails, it should pinpoint the location of the problem.
Tests should not rely on each other - Isolated. No assumptions about order of test execution. Ensure 'clean slate' before each test by using setup/teardown appropriately

Professional: In the long run you'll have as much test code as production (if not more), therefore follow the same standard of good-design for your test code. Well factored methods-classes with intention-revealing names, No duplication, tests with good names, etc. 
Good tests also run Fast. any test that takes over half a second to run.. needs to be worked upon. The longer the test suite takes for a run.. the less frequently it will be run. The more changes the dev will try to sneak between runs.. if anything breaks.. it will take longer to figure out which change was the culprit.

Update 2010-08:

Readable : This can be considered part of Professional - however it can't be stressed enough. An acid test would be to find someone who isn't part of your team and asking him/her to figure out the behavior under test within a couple of minutes. Tests need to be maintained just like production code - so make it easy to read even if it takes more effort. Tests should be symmetric (follow a pattern) and concise (test one behavior at a time). Use a consistent naming convention (e.g. the TestDox style). Avoid cluttering the test with ""incidental details"".. become a minimalist.

Apart from these, most of the others are guidelines that cut down on low-benefit work: e.g. 'Don't test code that you don't own' (e.g. third-party DLLs). Don't go about testing getters and setters. Keep an eye on cost-to-benefit ratio or defect probability.
"
61480,"The aim of the new automatic properties is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write when you just have a simple property that doesn't need any special logic in the get or the set. 
If you want to access the private member that these properties use, that's usually for a few reasons:

You need to more than just a simple get/set - in this case, you should just avoid using automatic properties for this member.
You want to avoid the performance hit of going through the get or set and just use the member directly - in this case, I'd be surprised if there really was a performance hit. The simple get/set members are very very easy to inline, and in my (admittedly limited) testing I haven't found a difference between using the automatic properties and accessing the member directly. 
You only want to have public read access (i.e. just a 'get') and the class write to the member directly - in this case, you can use a private set in your automatic property. i.e.
public class MyClass
{
    public int Age {get; private set;} 
}

This usually covers most the reasons for wanting to directly get to the backing field used by the automatic properties.

Cannot be used by programs that don't also use the same framework - There are OODB standards and you can use different frameworks
Versioning is probably a bit of a bitch - Versioning is actually easier!

The pros I'm interested in are:

Native queries - Db4o lets you write queries in your static typed language so you don't have to worry about mistyping a string and finding data missing at runtime,
Ease of use - Defining buissiness logic in the domain layer, persistence layer (mapping) and finally the SQL database is certainly violation of DRY. With OODB you define your domain where it belongs.

23.2.4.2 A vector satisfies all of the requirements of a container and of a reversible container (given in two tables in 23.1) and of a sequence, including most of the optional sequence requirements (23.1.1).


23.1.1.12 Table 68

operational semanticsa.erase(--a.end())

Notice that a.pop_back is equivalent to a.erase(--a.end()).  Looking at vector's specifics on erase:

23.2.4.3.3 - iterator erase(iterator position) - effects - Invalidates all the iterators and references after the point of the erase

Therefore, once you call pop_back, any iterators to the previously final element (which now no longer exists) are invalidated.
Looking at your code, the problem is that when you remove the final element and the list becomes empty, you still increment it and walk off the end of the list.

Debugging Tools for Windows has has a script (ADPLUS) that allows you to create dumps when a process CRASHES:

The command should be something like (if you are using IIS6):
cscript adplus.vbs -crash -pn w3wp.exe

This command will attach the debugger to the worker process. When the crash occurs it will generate a dump (a *.DMP file).
You can open it in WinDBG (also included in the Debugging Tools for Windows). File > Open Crash dump...
By default, WinDBG will show you (next to the command line) the thread were the process crashed.
The first thing you need to do in WinDBG is to load the .NET Framework extensions:
.loadby sos mscorwks

then, you will display the managed callstack:
!clrstack

if the thread was not running managed code, then you'll need to check the native stack:

Stability: Changing a key because of a business or natural need will negatively affect related tables.  Surrogate keys rarely, if ever, need to be changed because there is nothing tied to the value.

"
63100,"In general testers and documenters (and other non-developes)  are all equal members of a scrum team. The idea behind that is to minimize risk. 
Requiring a definition of done, which includes a potentially shipable product that's fully tested and documented, forces the project to come together at the end of each sprint.
If testing does not start until AFTER dev. is done, what happens is that a lot of bugs are discovered after the developers are done with a task. So now you have to fix those bugs, and that's very slow and expensive both because bugs interact and because the general rule is: ""The expense of fixing a bug grows exponentially with time.""  Bugs you catch early are cheap and easy to fix, late bugs are a nightmare.
That is why you want testing (and documentation) to move in step with development. And right now you should be asking, how! Testing is slow, how the heck can it move in step with dev? 
The answer is automation, that is SCRUM always sits on top of XP or Agile, both demand excellent unit test coverage and TDD. Here's another gotcha to watch out for. The features developers should be the ones writing both, unit and system test. All testing automation should be done by the feature dev. team. Some places split feature dev. from automation dev. and that's bad.
OK, so now you have great automated testing and you run it AT LEAST once a day. And obviously you practice continuous integration right? This reduces the work load of the testers by a huge amount. And that's how testing can stay in step with dev. One more thing, the testers now work on the really hard and creative stuff that's impossible or very difficult to automate, every time they find a bug that way, what ever it took to expose the bug is automated and becomes part of the daily regression tests. Phew, that's a long answer!
Now to the second part of your question. Scrum is about discipline.  Sprints are short and backlog changes during a sprint should NOT happen. Non technical work should be branched of onto a customer support team and they can do Scrum around that. You're right when you say that is sounds like your culture and practices are incompatible with scrum.
In my experience transitioning to Scrum/Agile is a very painful, stressful process and most attempts to transition fail. One of the key's to success is a champion for Scrum/Agile in the executive team. From your description it sounds like you don't have one.  
There are costs and benefits to Scrum, but you're doing it badly you might be incurring costs with little or no benefit.  If you're doing Scrum wrong and badly, you might be better off not doing Scrum at all.

Once you've got your terminal happily using 256 colours, the magic invocation is setting your terminal type to ""xterm-256color"" before you invoke emacs, e.g.:
env TERM=xterm-256color emacs -nw

Or, you can set TERM in your .bashrc file:

If you're really concerned about every clock cycle, you'd never write generic/dynamic game logic. It's a trade off between maintainable/configurable code and outright speed.

An Emacs copy is the command kill-ring-save (usually bound to M-w).

An X copy is ""physically"" highlighting text with the mouse cursor.
An Emacs paste is the command yank (usually bound to C-y).
A system paste is what you typically get from pressing C-v (or choosing ""Edit-Paste"" in an application window).
An X paste is pressing the ""center mouse button"" (simulated by pressing the left and right mouse buttons together).

In my case (on GNOME):

Both Emacs and system copy usually work with X paste.
X copy usually works with Emacs paste.
To make system copy work with Emacs paste and Emacs copy work with system paste, you need to add (setq x-select-enable-clipboard t) to your .emacs. Or try 
META-X set-variable RET x-select-enable-clipboard RET t


I think this is pretty standard modern Unix behavior.
It's also important to note (though you say you're using Emacs in a separate window) that when Emacs is running in a console, it is completely divorced from the system and X clipboards: cut and paste in that case is mediated by the terminal. For example, ""Edit->Paste"" in your terminal window should act exactly as if you typed the text from the clipboard into the Emacs buffer.

64420,"I found the answer after searching around. Here's what I have done:

Create a new project in XCode. I think I used the view-based app.
Drag a WebView object onto your interface and resize.
Inside of your WebViewController.m (or similarly named file, depending on the name of your view), in the viewDidLoad method:
NSString *filePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""index"" ofType:@""html""];  
NSData *htmlData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:filePath];  
if (htmlData) {  
  NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle]; 
  NSString *path = [bundle bundlePath];
  NSString *fullPath = [NSBundle pathForResource:@""index"" ofType:@""html"" inDirectory:path];
  [webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:fullPath]]];
}
Now any files you have added as resources to the project are available for use in your web app. I've got an index.html file including javascript and css and image files with no problems. The only limitation I've found so far is that I can't create new folders so all the files clutter up the resources folder.
Trick: make sure you've added the file as a resource in XCode or the file won't be available. I've been adding an empty file in XCode, then dragging my file on top in the finder. That's been working for me.

Note: I realize that Obj-C must not be that hard to learn. But since I already have this app existing in JS and I know it works in Safari this is a much faster dev cycle for me. Some day I'm sure I'll have to break down and learn Obj-C.

65200,"I wouldn't call throwing an OutOfMemoryError or StackOverflowError a crash. These are just normal exceptions. To really crash a VM there are 3 ways:

Use JNI and crash in the native code.
If no security manager is installed you can use reflection to crash the VM. This is VM specific, but normally a VM stores a bunch of pointers to native resources in private fields (e.g. a pointer to the native thread object is stored in a long field in java.lang.Thread). Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.
All VMs have bugs, so you just have to trigger one.

For the last method I have a short example, which will crash a Sun Hotspot VM quiet nicely:
public class Crash {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object[] o = null;

        while (true) {
            o = new Object[] {o};
        }
    }
}

This leads to a stack overflow in the GC so you will get no StackOverflowError but a real crash including a hs_err* file.

65820,"One unit testing framework in C is Check; a (LAST UPDATED ON 2008) list of unit testing frameworks in C can be found here and is reproduced below.  Depending on how many standard library functions your runtime has, you may or not be able to use one of those.

AceUnit
AceUnit (Advanced C and Embedded Unit) bills itself as a comfortable C code unit test framework. It tries to mimick JUnit 4.x and includes reflection-like capabilities. AceUnit can be used in resource constraint environments, e.g. embedded software development, and importantly it runs fine in environments where you cannot include a single standard header file and cannot invoke a single standard C function from the ANSI / ISO C libraries. It also has a Windows port. It does not use forks to trap signals, although the authors have expressed interest in adding such a feature. See the AceUnit homepage.
GNU Autounit
Much along the same lines as Check, including forking to run unit tests in a separate address space (in fact, the original author of Check borrowed the idea from GNU Autounit). GNU Autounit uses GLib extensively, which means that linking and such need special options, but this may not be a big problem to you, especially if you are already using GTK or GLib. See the GNU Autounit homepage.
cUnit
Also uses GLib, but does not fork to protect the address space of unit tests.
CUnit
Standard C, with plans for a Win32 GUI implementation. Does not currently fork or otherwise protect the address space of unit tests. In early development. See the CUnit homepage.
CuTest
A simple framework with just one .c and one .h file that you drop into your source tree. See the CuTest homepage.
CppUnit
The premier unit testing framework for C++; you can also use it to test C code. It is stable, actively developed, and has a GUI interface. The primary reasons not to use CppUnit for C are first that it is quite big, and second you have to write your tests in C++, which means you need a C++ compiler. If these donÃ¢ÂÂt sound like concerns, it is definitely worth considering, along with other C++ unit testing frameworks. See the CppUnit homepage.
embUnit
embUnit (Embedded Unit) is another unit test framework for embedded systems. This one appears to be superseded by AceUnit. Embedded Unit homepage.
MinUnit
A minimal set of macros and thatÃ¢ÂÂs it! The point is to show how easy it is to unit test your code. See the MinUnit homepage.
CUnit for Mr. Ando
A CUnit implementation that is fairly new, and apparently still in early development. See the CUnit for Mr. Ando homepage.
This list was last updated in March 2008.

Others:
CMocka
CMocka is a test framework for C with support for mock objects. It's easy to use and setup. CMocka official homepage.
Criterion
Criterion is a cross-platform C unit testing framework supporting automatic test registration, parameterized tests, theories, and that can output to multiple formats, including TAP and JUnit XML. Each test is run in its own process, so signals and crashes can be reported or tested if needed. See the Criterion homepage for more information.
HWUT
HWUT is a general Unit Test tool with great support for C. It can help to create Makefiles, generate massive test cases coded in minimal 'iteration tables', walk along state machines, generate C-stubs and more. The general approach is pretty unique: Verdicts are based on 'good stdout/bad stdout'. The comparison function, though, is flexible. Thus, any type of script may be used for checking. It may be applied to any language that can produce standard output. See HWUT homepage.

66330,"Perl has excellent utilities for doing testing. The most commonly used module is probably Test::More, which provides all the infrastructure you're likely to need for writing regression tests. The prove utility provides an easy interface for running test suites and summarizing the results. The Test::Differences module (which can be used with Test::More) might be useful to you as well. It formats differences as side-by-side comparisons. As for committing the actual output as the new reference material, that will depend on how your code under test provides output and how you capture it. It should be easy if you write to files and then compare them. If that's the case you might want to use the Text::Diff module within your test suite.

I wouldn't depend on it in your code.  If the JVM is about to throw an OutOfMemoryError, calling System.gc() won't stop it, because the garbage collector will attempt to free as much as it can before it goes to that extreme.  The only time I've seen it used in practice is in IDEs where it's attached to a button that a user can click, but even there it's not terribly useful.

67000,"The Pyglet library for Python might suit your needs. It lets you use OpenGL, a cross-platform graphics API. You can disable anti-aliasing and capture regions of the screen to a buffer or a file. In addition, you can use its event handling, resource loading, and image manipulation systems. You can probably also tie it into PIL (Python Image Library), and definitely Cairo, a popular cross-platform vector graphics library.
I mention Pyglet instead of pure PyOpenGL because Pyglet handles a lot of ugly OpenGL stuff transparently with no effort on your part.
A friend and I are currently working on a drawing program using Pyglet. There are a few quirks - for example, OpenGL is always double buffered on OS X, so we have to draw everything twice, once for the current frame and again for the other frame, since they are flipped whenever the display refreshes. You can look at our current progress in this subversion repository. (Splatterboard.py in trunk is the file you'll want to run.) If you're not up on using svn, I would be happy to email you a .zip of the latest source. Feel free to steal code if you look into it.

To change this colour to the colour of your background you need to add the following code to the DrawItem method (as described in Rajesh's solution). I'm using VB.Net:
...

Dim r As Rectangle = tabControl1.GetTabRect(tabControl1.TabPages.Count-1)
Dim rf As RectangleF = New RectangleF(r.X + r.Width, r.Y - 5, tabControl1.Width - (r.X + r.Width), r.Height + 5)
Dim b As Brush = New SolidBrush(Color.White)

Python makes this very easy: timeit is your friend.
$ python -m timeit ""x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)""

$ python -m timeit ""x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]""
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.363 usec per loop

$ python -m timeit -s ""x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)"" ""y=x[3]""
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0938 usec per loop

10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0649 usec per loop

So in this case, instantiation is almost an order of magnitude faster for the tuple, but item access is actually somewhat faster for the list! So if you're creating a few tuples and accessing them many many times, it may actually be faster to use lists instead.
Of course if you want to change an item, the list will definitely be faster since you'd need to create an entire new tuple to change one item of it (since tuples are immutable).

Adoption documents: ""NewPerson handbook"". Getting started with any ""framework"" or niche tools you are using. The best way might be to get the first bunch of newbies to collaborate on refining the content... listen to the Voice of the people. 
Instructions for Setting up a development machine is another good one. Source Control server settings, Installation paths for tools used.
Also document team conventions if any. 
Product Maps: You would need product design roadmaps - block diagrams of various top-level components and the like. Tests can serve as the always updated specs - ground zero documentation.. but you need a simple word doc ... bulleted list of high level product needs / features.
""Here the dragons lie"" - any known minefields with products (esp. legacy), 'Don't tread here' areas that you need to be careful while changing.. e.g. If you change something here, make sure you have it reviewed by Y and Z before checking in.
Update from Dimarzionist: Stash away decisions taken during development, reasons and supporting evidence (mail chains) if needed in a 'well-known place'

Core Metric: If you find no one on the team complaining ""WTH? Why didnt anyone document this? I'm stuck.. How am I supposed to proceed on this?"" - you're good.

If the team finds that they have been drawing a class diagram or sequence diagram over and over, that's proof that it is a useful artifact. Soon someone will make a sticky copy and save it somewhere to save time. Over time , the more useful artifacts would build up.

69250,"Without any optimization on, the flow through your code is linear.  If you are on line 5 and single step, you step to line 6.  With optimization on, you can get instruction re-ordering, loop unrolling and all sorts of optimizations.
For example:

void foo() {
1:  int i;
2:  for(i = 0; i < 2; )
3:    i++;
4:  return;

In this example, without optimization, you could single step through the code and hit lines 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4
With optimization on, you might get an execution path that looks like: 2, 3, 3, 4 or even just 4! (The function does nothing after all...)
Bottom line, debugging code with optimization enabled can be a royal pain! Especially if you have large functions.
Note that turning on optimization changes the code! In certain environment (safety critical systems), this is unacceptable and the code being debugged has to be the code shipped. Gotta debug with optimization on in that case.
While the optimized and non-optimized code should be ""functionally"" equivalent, under certain circumstances, the behavior will change.
Here is a simplistic example:

    int* ptr = 0xdeadbeef;  // some address to memory-mapped I/O device
    *ptr = 0;   // setup hardware device
    while(*ptr == 1) {    // loop until hardware device is done
       // do something
    }

With optimization off, this is straightforward, and you kinda know what to expect.
However, if you turn optimization on, a couple of things might happen:

The compiler might optimize the while block away (we init to 0, it'll never be 1)
Instead of accessing memory, pointer access might be moved to a register->No I/O Update
memory access might be cached (not necessarily compiler optimization related)

In all these cases, the behavior would be drastically different and most likely wrong.

For IE < 10 and Opera, you will need to use the unselectable attribute of the element you wish to be unselectable. You can set this using an attribute in HTML:
<div id=""foo"" unselectable=""on"" class=""unselectable"">...</div>

Sadly this property isn't inherited, meaning you have to put an attribute in the start tag of every element inside the <div>. If this is a problem, you could instead use JavaScript to do this recursively for an element's descendants:
function makeUnselectable(node) {
    if (node.nodeType == 1) {
        node.setAttribute(""unselectable"", ""on"");
    }
    var child = node.firstChild;
    while (child) {

Cryptography is not the solution to your security problems. It might be part of the solution, or it might be part of the problem. In many situations, cryptography starts out by making the problem worse, and it isn't at all clear that using cryptography is an improvement.

Essentially encrypting your emails in the database 'just in case' is not really making the database more secure. Where are the keys stored for the database? What file permissions are used for these keys? Is the database accesable publically? Why? What kind of account restrictions are in place for these accounts? Where is the machine stored, who has physical access to this box? What about remote login/ssh access etc. etc. etc.
So I guess you can encrypt the emails if you want, but if that is the extent of the security of the system then it really isn't doing much, and would actually make the job of maintaining the database harder.
Of course this could be part of an extensive security policy for your system - if so then great!
I'm not saying that it is a bad idea - But why have a lock on the door from Deadlocks'R'us which cost $5000 when they can cut through the plywood around the door? Or come in through the window which you left open? Or even worse they find the key which was left under the doormat. Security of a system is only as good as the weakest link. If they have root access then they can pretty much do what they want.
Steve Morgan makes a good point that even if they cannot understand the email addresses, they can still do a lot of harm (which could be mitigated if they only had SELECT access)
Its also important to know what your reasons are for storing the email address at all. I might have gone a bit overboard with this answer, but my point is do you really need to store an email address for an account? The most secure data is data that doesn't exist.

As you guessed, first you count how many times words appear in the text (usually called document in the NLP-lingo). Then you throw out the so called stop words, such as ""the"", ""a"", ""or"" and so on.
You're left with words and word counts. Do this for a while and you get a comprehensive set of words that appear in your documents. You can then create an index for these words:
""aardvark"" is 1, ""apple"" is 2, ..., ""z-index"" is 70092. 
Now you can take your word bags and turn them into vectors. For example, if your document contains two references for aardvarks and nothing else, it would look like this:
[2 0 0 ... 70k zeroes ... 0].

After this you can count the ""angle"" between the two vectors with a dot product. The smaller the angle, the closer the documents are.

70600,"Yes, my preferred way of doing this would be via PHP. You'd have to set up a script which would load up the file and send it to the user browser. This script would also be able to log the download somewhere (e.g. your database).
For example - in very rough pseudo-code:
download.php
$file = $_GET['file'];
updateFileCount($file);
header('Content-Type: image/jpeg');
sendFile($file);

Then, you just have your download link point to download.php instead of the actual file. (Note that updateFileCount and sendFile are functions that you would have to provide, of course - this script is an example of a download script which you could use)
Note: I highly recommend avoiding the use of $_GET['file'] to get the whole filename - malicious users could use it to retrieve sensitive files from your web server. But the safe use of PHP downloads is a topic for another question.

71720,"The answer I discovered eventually was that while OpenGL only has its one amalgamated MODELVIEW matrix, in D3D the ""world"" and ""view"" transforms are kept separate, and placing lights seems to be the major reason for this.  So the answer is you use D3DTS_VIEW to set up matrices that should apply to your lights, and D3DTS_WORLD to set up matrices that apply to the placement of your geometry in the world.
So actually the D3D system kinda makes more sense than the OpenGL way.  It allows you to specify your light positions whenever and wherever the heck you feel like it once and for all, without having to constantly reposition them so that they get transformed by your  current ""view"" transform.  OpenGL has to work that way because it simply doesn't know what you think your ""view"" is vs your ""model"".  It's all just a modelview to GL.

"
71980,"First, you might not actually have to do anything at all, if all you need to do is read the contents. A BSTR type is a pointer to a null-terminated wchar_t array already. In fact, if you check the headers, you will find that BSTR is essentially defined as:
typedef BSTR wchar_t*;

So, the compiler can't distinguish between them, even though they have different semantics.
There is are two important caveat.

BSTRs are supposed to be immutable. You should never change the contents of a BSTR after it has been initialized. If you ""change it"", you have to create a new one assign the new pointer and release the old one (if you own it).
[UPDATE: this is not true; sorry! You can modify BSTRs in place; I very rarely have had the need.]
BSTRs are allowed to contain embedded null characters, whereas traditional C/C++ strings are not.

If you have a fair amount of control of the source of the BSTR, and can guarantee that the BSTR does not have embedded NULLs, you can read from the BSTR as if it was a wchar_t and use conventional string methods (wcscpy, etc) to access it. If not, your life gets harder. You will have to always manipulate your data as either more BSTRs, or as a dynamically-allocated array of wchar_t. Most string-related functions will not work correctly.
Let's assume you control your data, or don't worry about NULLs. Let's assume also that you really need to make a copy and can't just read the existing BSTR directly. In that case, you can do something like this:
UINT length = SysStringLen(myBstr);        // Ask COM for the size of the BSTR
wchar_t *myString = new wchar_t[lenght+1]; // Note: SysStringLen doesn't 
                                           // include the space needed for the NULL

wcscpy(myString, myBstr);                  // Or your favorite safer string function

// ...

delete myString; // Done

If you are using class wrappers for your BSTR, the wrapper should have a way to call SysStringLen() for you. For example:
CComBString    use .Length();
_bstr_t        use .length();

UPDATE: This is a good article on the subject by someone far more knowledgeable than me:

72010,"The two Ã¢ÂÂoverloadsÃ¢ÂÂ aren't in the same scope. By default, the compiler only considers the smallest possible name scope until it finds a name match.

72240,"The way I've accomplished something similar in the past is by using direct binding ports in the orchestrations and letting the MsgBox do the dirty work for me. Basically, it goes something like this:

Make the callable orchestrations use a direct-bound port attached to your activating receive shape.
Set up a filter expression on your activating receive shape with a custom context-based property and set it equal to a value that uniquely identifies the orchestration (such as the orchestration name or whatever)
In the calling orchestration, create the message you'll want to use to fire the new orchestration. In that message, set your custom context property to the value that matches the filter used in the specific orchestration you want to fire.
Send the message through a direct-bound send port so that it gets sent to the MsgBox directly and the Pub/Sub mechanisms in BizTalk will take care of the rest.

One thing to watch out in step 4: To have this work correctly, you will need to create a new Correlation Set type that includes your custom context property, and then make sure that the direct-bound send port ""follows"" the correlation set on the send. Otherwise, the custom property will only be written (and not promoted) to the msg context and the routing will fail.

72580,"As far as my experience in Flex/AIR/Flash actionscripting goes, Adobe AIR development environment and coding/debugging toolsets are far inferior to the Visual Studio and .NET SDK as of the moment. The UI toolsets are superior though.
But as you already have a working C# code, porting it to ActionScript might requires a redesign due to ActionScript having a different way of thinking/programming, they use different primitive data types, for example, they use just a Number instead of int float double etc. and the debugging tools are quiet lacking compared to VS IMO.
And I heard that Mono's GtkSharp is quiet a decent platform.
But if you don't mind the coding/debugging tooling problems, then AIR is a great platform. I like how Adobe integrates the Flash experience into it e.g. you can start an installation of AIR application via a button click in a flash movieclip, that kind of integration.

73930,"You use a .desktop file for icons under linux.  Where to put the icon depends on what distribution and what desktop environment you are using.  Since I'm currently running Gnome on Fedora 9, I will answer it in those terms.
An example foo.desktop file would be:
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
GenericName=Generic Piece Of Software
Name=FooBar
Exec=/usr/bin/foo.sh
Icon=foo.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Qt;Gnome;Applications;

The .desktop file should under Fedora 9 Gnome be located in /usr/share/applications/ , you can run a locate on .desktop to figure out where you should put in on your distro.  Gnome will generally look in the KDE icon directory to see if there are other icons there also....

Encoding, Name and Exec should speak for themselves.

Generic name == Brief Description of application.
Icon == The image to display for the icon
Terminal == Is this a terminal application, should I start it as one?
Type == Type of program this is, can be used in placing the icon in a menu.
Categories == This information is what is mainly used to place the icon in a given menu if an XML file to specify such is not present.  The setup for menus is handled a little differently by everyone.


There are more attributes you can set, but they aren't strictly necessary.
The image file used sits somewhere in the bowels of the /usr/share/icons/ directory.  You can parse through that to find all the wonders of how such things work, but the basics are that you pick the directory for the icon type (in my case gnome) and place the image within the appropriate directory (there is a scalable directory for .svg images, and specific sizes such as 48x48 for raster images.  Under Gnome all images are generally .png).

vulnerability to data errors (if you ever get two rows, it raises a TOO_MANY_ROWS exception)

Example
SELECT col INTO var FROM table WHERE something;

An explicit cursor is one you create yourself. It takes more code, but gives more control - for example, you can just open-fetch-close if you only want the first record and don't care if there are others.

    createOMNamespace(""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"", ""xsi"");

OMNamespace xsi = fac.createOMNamespace(""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"", ""xsi"");

If your use-cases never require updates to both databases within the same transaction, then you can use two JpaTransactionManagers, but I'm not sure you will be able to use the @Transactional approach? In this case, you would need to fallback on the older mechanism of using a simple TransactionProxyFactoryBean to define transaction boundaries, eg:
<bean id=""firstRealService"" class=""com.acme.FirstServiceImpl""/>
<bean id=""firstService""  
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean"">
    <property name=""transactionManager"" ref=""firstJpaTm""/>
    <property name=""target"" ref=""firstRealService""/>
    <property name=""transactionAttributes"">
        <props>
           <prop key=""insert*"">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
           <prop key=""update*"">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
           <prop key=""*"">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly</prop>
        </props>
    </property>
</bean>
<!-- similar for your second service -->

If you are require a transaction spanning both databases, then you will need to use a JTA transaction manager. The API states:

This transaction manager is appropriate for applications that use a single JPA EntityManagerFactory for transactional data access. JTA (usually through JtaTransactionManager) is necessary for accessing multiple transactional resources within the same transaction. Note that you need to configure your JPA provider accordingly in order to make it participate in JTA transactions.

What this means is that you will need to provide a JTA transaction manager. In our application, we use config similar to the following:
<tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager=""txManager""/>

<bean id=""txManager"" 
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"">
    <property name=""transactionManagerName"" value=""appserver/jndi/path"" />
</bean>

If you are deploying within an appserver, then the spring JtaTransactionManager needs to do a lookup to the real XA-compliant JTA transaction manager provided by the appserver. However, you can also use a standalone JTA transaction manager (but I haven't tried this myself yet)
As for configuring the Jpa persistence provider, I'm not that familiar. What JPA persistence provider are you using?
The code above is based on our approach, where we were using native Hibernate as opposed to Hibernate's JPA implementation. In this case, we were able to get rid of the two HibernateTransactionManager beans, and simply ensure that both SessionFactories were injected with the same JTA TM, and then use the tx:annotation-driven element.
Hope this helps

Use encodeURIComponent when you want to encode a URL parameter.
param1 = encodeURIComponent(""http://xyz.com/?a=12&b=55"")

Then you may create the URL you need:

As a fundamental principle, we do not want to be responsible for the loss of sensitive data. The users are perfectly good at that, themselves.

Developers don't **need** access to production data. It's simply laziness. Define and create test data to exercise defined test cases (including edge cases) and don't rely on the random-esque nature of production data.
If you **must** use production data (i.e. you manage to convince someone who doesn't know any better that it's acceptable), ensure the data is anonymised **before** it reaches the development estate.

76870,"Step 1: Define a property in your NAnt script to track the environment you're building for (local, test, production, etc.).
<property name=""environment"" value=""local"" />

Step 2: If you don't already have a configuration or initialization target that all targets depends on, then create a configuration target, and make sure your other targets depend on it.
<target name=""config"">
    <!-- configuration logic goes here -->
</target>

<target name=""buildmyproject"" depends=""config"">
    <!-- this target builds your project, but runs the config target first -->
</target>

Step 3: Update your configuration target to pull in an appropriate properties file based on the environment property.
<target name=""config"">
    <property name=""configFile"" value=""${environment}.config.xml"" />
    <if test=""${file::exists(configFile)}"">
        <echo message=""Loading ${configFile}..."" />
        <include buildfile=""${configFile}"" />

    <if test=""${not file::exists(configFile) and environment != 'local'}"">
        <fail message=""Configuration file '${configFile}' could not be found."" />

Note, I like to allow team members to define their own local.config.xml files that don't get committed to source control.  This provides a nice place to store local connection strings or other local environment settings.

78450,"Well, it looks as if I will be answering my own question.
First, the documentation flat out lies where it reads ""In any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings 'splitlast' or 'splitfirst' to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table, or the first row of a continuation.""  In the current release, the ""splitlast"" and ""splitfirst"" row indices break with the aforementioned TypeErrors on the TEXTCOLOR and BACKGROUND commnds.
My suspicion, based on reading the source code, is that only the tablestyle line commands (GRID, BOX, LINEABOVE, and LINEBELOW) are currently compatible with the 'splitfirst' and 'splitlast' row indices.  I suspect that all cell commands break with the aforementioned TypeErrors.
However, I was able to do what I wanted by subclassing the Table class and overriding the onSplit method.  Here is my code:
class XTable(Table):
    def onSplit(self, T, byRow=1):
        T.setStyle(TableStyle([
          ('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 1), (1, 1), colors.black)]))

What this does is apply the text color black to the first and second cell of the second row of each page.  (The first row is a header, repeated by the repeatRows parameter of the Table.)  More precisely, it is doing this to the first and second cell of each frame, but since I am using the SimpleDocTemplate, frames and pages are identical.

79850,"Designing a bigtable schema is an open process, and basically requires you to think about:

The access patterns you will be using and how often each will be used
The relationships between your types
What indices you are going to need
The write patterns you will be using (in order to effectively spread load)

GAE's datastore automatically denormalizes your data. That is, each index contains a (mostly) complete copy of the data, and thus every index adds significantly to time taken to perform a write, and the storage space used.
If this were not the case, designing a Datastore schema would be a lot more work: You would have to think carefully about the primary key for each type, and consider the effect of your decision on the locality of data. For example, when rendering a blog post you would probably need to display the comments to go along with it, so each comment's key would probably begin with the associated post's key.
With Datastore, this is not such a big deal: The query you use will look something like ""Select * FROM Comment WHERE post_id = N."" (If you want to page the comments, you would also have a limit clause, and a possible suffix of "" AND comment_id > last_comment_id"".) Once you add such a query, Datastore will build the index for you, and your reads will be magically fast.
Something to keep in mind is that each additional index creates some additional cost: it is best if you can use as few access patterns as possible, since it will reduce the number of indices GAE will construct, and thus the total storage required by your data.
Reading over this answer, I find it a little vague. Maybe a hands-on design question would help to scope this down? :-)

79960,"By using the wordwrap function. It splits the texts in multiple lines such that the maximum width is the one you specified, breaking at word boundaries. After splitting, you simply take the first line:
substr($string, 0, strpos(wordwrap($string, $your_desired_width), ""\n""));

One thing this oneliner doesn't handle is the case when the text itself is shorter than the desired width. To handle this edge-case, one should do something like:
if (strlen($string) > $your_desired_width) 
{
    $string = wordwrap($string, $your_desired_width);
    $string = substr($string, 0, strpos($string, ""\n""));
}


The above solution has the problem of prematurely cutting the text if it contains a newline before the actual cutpoint. Here a version which solves this problem:
function tokenTruncate($string, $your_desired_width) {
  $parts = preg_split('/([\s\n\r]+)/', $string, null, PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE);
  $parts_count = count($parts);

  $length = 0;
  $last_part = 0;
  for (; $last_part < $parts_count; ++$last_part) {
    $length += strlen($parts[$last_part]);
    if ($length > $your_desired_width) { break; }
  }

  return implode(array_slice($parts, 0, $last_part));
}

Also, here is the PHPUnit testclass used to test the implementation:
class TokenTruncateTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {
  public function testBasic() {
    $this->assertEquals(""1 3 5 7 9 "",
      tokenTruncate(""1 3 5 7 9 11 14"", 10));
  }

  public function testEmptyString() {
    $this->assertEquals("""",
      tokenTruncate("""", 10));
  }

  public function testShortString() {
    $this->assertEquals(""1 3"",
      tokenTruncate(""1 3"", 10));
  }

  public function testStringTooLong() {
    $this->assertEquals("""",
      tokenTruncate(""toooooooooooolooooong"", 10));
  }

  public function testContainingNewline() {
    $this->assertEquals(""1 3\n5 7 9 "",
      tokenTruncate(""1 3\n5 7 9 11 14"", 10));

EDIT :

Build Agents. It's very simple to turn any box into a build machine and run a build on it. MSFT got this one right.
Reporting. All relevant build results (test included) are stored in a SQL database and reported on via SQL Server Reporting Services. This is an immensely powerful tool for charting build and test results over time. CC Net doesn't have this built in.
You can do similar customizations via MSBUILD. It's basically the same as using NAnt with CC Net

Here's what drives me up the wall about Team Foundation Build:

To build C++/CLI projects (or run unit tests...?) the build agent must have VSTS Dev or Team Suite installed. This, friends, is just batsh*t crazy.
It must be connected to the TFS Mothership

If you're in a big org with lots of bosses who have huge budgets and love reports (and don't get me wrong, this has huge value) OR you need to scale up to a multi-machine build farm, I'd prefer Team Foundation Build. 
If you're a leaner shop, stick with CC Net and grow your own reporting solutions. That's what we did.

81180,"
In IE7 (and probably all famous browsers, including old Firefox 2), if we submit a file like '//server1/path/to/file/filename' it works properly and gives the full path to the file and the filename.
I have no clue how to overcome this 'new feature' because it causes all upload forms in my webapp to stop working on Firefox 3.

There's a major misunderstanding here. Why do you ever need the full file path on the server side? Imagine that I am the client and I have a file at C:\path\to\passwords.txt and I give the full file path to you. How would you as being a server ever get its contents? Do you have an open TCP connection to my local disk file system? Did you test the file upload functionality when you've brought your webapp into production on a different server machine?
It will only work when both the client and server runs at physically the same machine, because you will then have the access to the same hard disk file system. This would only occur when you're locally developing your website and thus both the webbrowser (client) and webserver (server) by coincidence runs at the same machine.
That the full file path is being sent in MSIE and other ancient webbrowsers is due to a security bug. The W3 and RFC2388 specifications have never mentioned to include the full file path. Only the file name. Firefox is doing its job correctly.
To handle uploaded files, you should not need to know the full file path. You should rather be interested in the full file contents which the client has already sent to the server in the request body in case of a multipart/form-data request. Change your form to look like the following as stated in RFC2388:
<form action=""upload-script-url"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
    <input type=""file"" name=""file"">
    <input type=""submit"">
</form>

How to obtain the contents of the uploaded file in the server side depends on the server side programming language you're using.

Java/JSP: you'd like to use HttpServletRequest#getPart() or Apache Commons FileUpload API to parse it. You should end up with an InputStream with the file contents which you in turn can write to any OutputStream to your taste. You can find an example in this answer.
Java/JSF: you'd like to use <h:inputFile> component or any other file upload component provided by the component library you're using. Also here, you'd like to obtain the file contents in flavor of an InputStream. See this answer for an example.
PHP: the file contents is already implicitly stored on the temp disk. You'd like to use move_uploaded_file() function to move it to the desired location. See also PHP manual.
ASP.NET: no detailed answer from me since I don't do it, but Google has found some examples for me: ASP.NET example, ASP.NET 2.0 example

Whenever you want to obtain the file name part of the uploaded file, you should trim the full path off from the file name. This information is namely completely irrelevant to you. Also see for example this Apache Commons FileUpload FAQ entry

Why does FileItem.getName() return the whole path, and not just the file name?
Internet Explorer provides the entire path to the uploaded file and not just the base file name. Since FileUpload provides exactly what was supplied by the client (browser), you may want to remove this path information in your application.

81410,"you could always petition wp to add your widget to their 'approved' list, but who knows how long that would take. you're talking about a way to circumvent the rules they have in place about posting arbitrary script. myspace javascript exploits in particular have increased awareness of the possibility of such workarounds, so you might have a tough time getting around the restrictions - however, here's a classic ones to try:
put the javascript in a weird place, like anywhere that executes a URL. for instance:
<div style=""background:url('javascript:alert(this);');"" />

sometimes the word 'javascript' gets cut out, but occasionally you can sneak it through as java\nscript, or something similar.
sometimes quotes get stripped out - try String.fromCharCode(34) to get around that. Also, in general, using eval(""codepart1"" + ""codepart2"") to get around restricted words or characters.
sneaking in javascript is a tricky business, mostly utilizing unorthodox (possibly un-documented) browser behavior in order to execute arbitrary javascript on a page. Welcome to hacking.

81520,"In order to silence the message, you must be redirecting stderr at the time the message is generated. Because the kill command sends a signal and doesn't wait for the target process to respond, redirecting stderr of the kill command does you no good. The bash builtin wait was made specifically for this purpose.
Here is very simple example that kills the most recent background command. (Learn more about $! here.)
kill $!
wait $! 2>/dev/null

Because both kill and wait accept multiple pids, you can also do batch kills. Here is an example that kills all background processes (of the current process/script of course).
kill $(jobs -rp)
wait $(jobs -rp) 2>/dev/null

I was led here from bash: silently kill background function process.

81830,"One other thing worth mentioning: the design philosophy of both framework is somewhat different when it comes to the model. Grails is more ""domain-oriented"" while Rails is more ""database-oriented"".
In Rails, you essentially start by defining your tables (with field names and their specifics). Then ActiveRecord will map them to Ruby classes or models.
In Grails, it's the reverse: you start by defining your models (Groovy classes) and when you hit run, GORM (Grails ActiveRecord equivalent) will create the related database and tables (or update them). Which may also be why you don't have the concept of 'migrations' in Grails (although I think it will come in some future release).
I don't know if one is better than the other. I guess it depends on your context.
This being said, I'm still myself wondering which one to choose. As Tom was saying, if you're dependent on Java you can still go for JRuby - so Java reuse shouldn't be your sole criterion.

81870,"C++11 update to a very old question: Print variable type in C++.
The accepted (and good) answer is to use typeid(a).name(), where a is a variable name.
Now in C++11 we have decltype(x), which can turn an expression into a type.  And decltype() comes with its own set of very interesting rules.  For example decltype(a) and decltype((a)) will generally be different types (and for good and understandable reasons once those reasons are exposed).
Will our trusty typeid(a).name() help us explore this brave new world?
No.
But the tool that will is not that complicated.  And it is that tool which I am using as an answer to this question.  I will compare and contrast this new tool to typeid(a).name().  And this new tool is actually built on top of typeid(a).name().
The fundamental issue:
typeid(a).name()

throws away cv-qualifiers, references, and lvalue/rvalue-ness.  For example:
const int ci = 0;
std::cout << typeid(ci).name() << '\n';

For me outputs:
i

and I'm guessing on MSVC outputs:
int

I.e. the const is gone.  This is not a QOI (Quality Of Implementation) issue.  The standard mandates this behavior.
What I'm recommending below is:
template <typename T> std::string type_name();

which would be used like this:
const int ci = 0;
std::cout << type_name<decltype(ci)>() << '\n';

and for me outputs:
int const

<disclaimer> I have not tested this on MSVC. </disclaimer>  But I welcome feedback from those who do.
The C++11 Solution
I am using __cxa_demangle for non-MSVC platforms as recommend by ipapadop in his answer to demangle types.  But on MSVC I'm trusting typeid to demangle names (untested).  And this core is wrapped around some simple testing that detects, restores and reports cv-qualifiers and references to the input type.
#include <type_traits>
#include <typeinfo>
#ifndef _MSC_VER
#   include <cxxabi.h>
#endif
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>

template <class T>
std::string
type_name()
{
    typedef typename std::remove_reference<T>::type TR;
    std::unique_ptr<char, void(*)(void*)> own
           (
#ifndef _MSC_VER
                abi::__cxa_demangle(typeid(TR).name(), nullptr,
                                           nullptr, nullptr),
#else
                nullptr,
#endif
                std::free
           );
    std::string r = own != nullptr ? own.get() : typeid(TR).name();
    if (std::is_const<TR>::value)
        r += "" const"";
    if (std::is_volatile<TR>::value)
        r += "" volatile"";
    if (std::is_lvalue_reference<T>::value)
        r += ""&"";
    else if (std::is_rvalue_reference<T>::value)
        r += ""&&"";
    return r;
}

The Results
With this solution I can do this:
int& foo_lref();
int&& foo_rref();
int foo_value();

int
main()
{
    int i = 0;
    const int ci = 0;
    std::cout << ""decltype(i) is "" << type_name<decltype(i)>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype((i)) is "" << type_name<decltype((i))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(ci) is "" << type_name<decltype(ci)>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype((ci)) is "" << type_name<decltype((ci))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(static_cast<int&>(i)) is "" << type_name<decltype(static_cast<int&>(i))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(static_cast<int&&>(i)) is "" << type_name<decltype(static_cast<int&&>(i))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(static_cast<int>(i)) is "" << type_name<decltype(static_cast<int>(i))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(foo_lref()) is "" << type_name<decltype(foo_lref())>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(foo_rref()) is "" << type_name<decltype(foo_rref())>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(foo_value()) is "" << type_name<decltype(foo_value())>() << '\n';
}

and the output is:
decltype(i) is int
decltype((i)) is int&
decltype(ci) is int const
decltype((ci)) is int const&
decltype(static_cast<int&>(i)) is int&
decltype(static_cast<int&&>(i)) is int&&
decltype(static_cast<int>(i)) is int
decltype(foo_lref()) is int&
decltype(foo_rref()) is int&&
decltype(foo_value()) is int

Note (for example) the difference between decltype(i) and decltype((i)).  The former is the type of the declaration of i.  The latter is the ""type"" of the expression i. (expressions never have reference type, but as a convention decltype represents lvalue expressions with lvalue references).
Thus this tool is an excellent vehicle just to learn about decltype, in addition to exploring and debugging your own code.
In contrast, if I were to build this just on typeid(a).name(), without adding back lost cv-qualifiers or references, the output would be:
decltype(i) is int
decltype((i)) is int
decltype(ci) is int
decltype((ci)) is int
decltype(static_cast<int&>(i)) is int
decltype(static_cast<int&&>(i)) is int
decltype(static_cast<int>(i)) is int
decltype(foo_lref()) is int
decltype(foo_rref()) is int
decltype(foo_value()) is int

I.e. Every reference and cv-qualifier is stripped off.
C++14 Update
Just when you think you've got a solution to a problem nailed, someone always comes out of nowhere and shows you a much better way. :-)
This answer from Jamboree shows how to get the type name in C++14 at compile time.  It is a brilliant solution for a couple reasons:

It's at compile time!
You get the compiler itself to do the job instead of a library (even a std::lib).  This means more accurate results for the latest language features (like lambdas).

Jamboree's answer doesn't quite lay everything out for VS, and I'm tweaking his code a little bit.  But since this answer gets a lot of views, take some time to go over there and upvote his answer, without which, this update would never have happened.
